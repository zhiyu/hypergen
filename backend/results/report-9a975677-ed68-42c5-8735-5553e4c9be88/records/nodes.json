Analysis Sub-task Needed?\n- The task requires writing about what's new about MUSE\n- We need a clear structure to organize recent developments, achievements, releases, tours, etc.\n- No dependent design tasks or completed content is provided\n- Therefore, we need an analysis sub-task to create a detailed outline and determine key aspects to cover\n\n2. Search Sub-task Needed?\n- Writing about \"what's new\" requires very recent and up-to-date information\n- We need to search for:\n- Latest album releases\n- Recent tours and concerts\n- New music videos or singles\n- Recent interviews or statements\n- Current band activities\n- Latest developments or announcements\n- No dependent search tasks or completed content is provided\n- Therefore, we definitely need a search sub-task\n\n3. Writing Sub-task Breakdown Needed?\n- The required length is 1000 words\n- This is below the 1500-word threshold that requires mandatory breakdown\n- Given the scope, 1000 words can be managed in a single writing task\n- Therefore, no writing sub-task breakdown is needed\n\nConclusion: Since both analysis and search sub-tasks are needed, this is a complex task that requires further planning."

Upcoming Major Developments\n\nThe legendary rock band MUSE is gearing up for an exciting new chapter with their highly anticipated album \"Eclipse,\" scheduled for release on March 20, 2025 [reference:18]. This announcement has generated significant buzz among fans worldwide, as it marks their first studio release since the successful \"Will of the People\" in 2022.\n\nThe band's 2025 world tour plans are taking shape, with an impressive lineup of performances scheduled across multiple continents. The tour will strategically coincide with the release of \"Eclipse,\" allowing fans to experience the new material live alongside classic favorites [reference:18]. The production promises to maintain MUSE's reputation for groundbreaking live performances, featuring their signature combination of theatrical elements and cutting-edge technology.\n\nFestival appearances for 2025 showcase MUSE's continued dominance in the live music scene. A particularly noteworthy highlight is their headlining slot at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, on June 22, 2025 - marking their triumphant return to the festival after a decade-long absence [reference:20]. The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].\n\nLooking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project \"in the next couple of months\" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.\n\n## 2. Recent Album Success - \"Will of the People\"\n\n\"Will of the People,\" released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for £20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since \"The 2nd Law\" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].\n\nCommercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].\n\nCritical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as \"the best music in these years\" [reference:1,3].\n\n## 3. Recent Tours and Performances\n\nThe Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13]. Memorable performances included shows at Madison Square Garden and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, where the band delivered extensive 22-song setlists [reference:11,14].\n\nThe European and Asian legs of the tour were equally impressive, with standout performances at iconic venues like Rome's Stadio Olimpico and London's O2 Arena [reference:9]. The shows have consistently featured elaborate production elements, including a square main stage with catwalk, transparent floor for lighting effects, and custom costumes including masks for specific songs [reference:13].\n\n## 4. Band Members' Activities\n\nChris Wolstenholme has embarked on an exciting new venture with his \"Chromes\" project, releasing two debut singles: \"Imaginary World\" and \"The Good Life\" [reference:25]. This marks his first major project as frontman and lyricist since his contributions to MUSE's \"The 2nd Law\" [reference:25].\n\nMatt Bellamy has been balancing personal and professional developments, recently welcoming his second child while also creating a musical score for Audible's adaptation of George Orwell's \"1984\" [reference:23]. He has also been engaging in public discourse, sharing his perspectives on \"Meta-Centrism\" and various social issues [reference:23].\n\n## 5. Future Outlook and Current Status\n\nMUSE currently stands at an interesting crossroads, operating as an unsigned band while exploring future label options [reference:23,24]. Despite this transition period, their creative output remains strong, with multiple projects in development. The band's current direction suggests a balance between maintaining their signature sound while continuing to push boundaries both musically and technologically. With two albums planned for the next two years and an extensive touring schedule, MUSE appears poised for another exciting chapter in their illustrious career."

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nBackground and recording\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nPromotion and release\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nComposition\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\n|---|---|\n| Source | Rating |\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\n| Review scores | |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | [32] |\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\n| DIY | [34] |\n| Gigwise | [35] |\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\n| NME | [38] |\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nCommercial performance\n[edit]In the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nTrack listing\n[edit]All tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\n| No. | Title | Length |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | \"Will of the People\" | 3:18 |\n| 2. | \"Compliance\" | 4:10 |\n| 3. | \"Liberation\" | 3:06 |\n| 4. | \"Won't Stand Down\" | 3:29 |\n| 5. | \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" | 3:36 |\n| 6. | \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" | 3:00 |\n| 7. | \"Kill or Be Killed\" | 5:00 |\n| 8. | \"Verona\" | 4:56 |\n| 9. | \"Euphoria\" | 3:23 |\n| 10. | \"We Are Fucking Fucked\" | 3:36 |\n| Total length: | 37:40 |\nPersonnel\n[edit]|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nCharts\n[edit]\nWeekly charts[edit]\n|\nYear-end charts[edit]\n|\nCertifications\n[edit]| Region | Certification | Certified units/sales |\n|---|---|---|\n| France (SNEP)[86] | Platinum | 100,000‡ |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[87] | Gold | 100,000‡ |\n|\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Instagram\".\n- ^ a b Moore, Sam (16 May 2022). \"Matt Bellamy says Muse's 'Will Of The People' is \"a greatest hits album – of new songs\"\".

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\nTracce\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nFormazione\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\n- Gruppo\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Produzione\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\n- Andrea \"Waarp\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\nClassifiche\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\n|---|---|\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\nNote\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\nAccording to Muse, \"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[5]\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \"Best-Of Album\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \"RTL 2\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\nBackground\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\", adding \"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\".\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\nRecording\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \"totally resetting\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely. Producer Aleks Von Korff, who previously worked with Muse as an engineer on Simulation Theory, and produced Bellamy's solo material - songs like Tomorrow's World - also posted a picture from Red Room during that time, with the wooden Kawai piano.\nBetween April and June 2021, the band took a break from recording, to work on a remix of Origin of Symmetry. In early June, Matt and Dom joined Chris in the UK, continuing work on the album.[16] With the entire band back together in person, recording continued at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2021. The band were also joined by Muse's long-time engineer, Adrian Bushby, who posted a picture of him and Howard at Abbey Road Studios tracking drums.[17] This makes the upcoming album the second LP to be partially recorded at Abbey Road, after 20 years, when Origin of Symmetry was recorded at the facility. The album appears to have also been partially recorded at RAK Studios at the end of 2021, with Tre Cool from Green Day mentioned meeting up with Muse during their stay at the studio whilst recording their album, Saviors.[18]\nOn December 1st, 2021, Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer at Sterling Sound Studios posted a picture of Bellamy and Howard sitting on a couch, with the entire album at the mastering stage during that time. [19]\nRelease\nOn December 25th, 2021, Bellamy made up for the lack of a muse.mu Christmas present with a short livestream from his Tesla, on Muse's Instagram profile, showcasing part of Won't Stand Down. The 60 second stream was then screen-recorded by a few people, with copyright bots deleting the posts, hinting at the song being near its release. Matt's minute-long stream can be listened to here. The then-approaching release of the song was teased once again on Muse's New Years Eve Instagram post, when they wrote a caption saying \"Looking forward to WSD. We'll see you on the other side!\", before quickly replacing \"WSD\" with \"2022\". Won't Stand Down was subsequently announced a week later, on January 7th, 2022, on Muse's social media[21], with wontstanddown.muse.mu spotted being online a day earlier. Together with it also came the single artwork and a new promo image of the band. The song was released on January 13th, 2022, on digital platforms.\nAlmost two months later, on March 2nd, 2022, Bellamy posted an Instagram story in which he went over the guitar tuning for Won't Stand Down, while mentioning that a second heavy song will appear on the album.[22]\nOn March 9th, 2022, Muse posted a short, half-minute album teaser video on their YouTube, simply titled \"MUSE\", which depicts statues of the band's heads being torn down by a group of rioters in the middle of a desert, while wearing mirror masks from the Won't Stand Down music video, with a choir of Matts chanting the line \"The Will of the People\", name of the album and title track, with album artwork displayed at the very end of the video.[23]\nTwo days later, on March 11th, 2022, it was discovered by Muse fans that the index code from wontstanddown.muse.mu, contains basic album info, including the tracklist and anagrams for each song which will appear on the album. The same day, Muse announced a new song/single, Compliance. The song, and its music video, leaked on March 15th through Vimeo, before being deleted from the platform on the same day. A day later, anagrams from the wontstanddown index code were also resolved, leaking song titles and the tracklist. Compliance's music video was announced together with the album name on March 16th[24].\nThe album's release date has finally been announced, together with the release of Compliance, on March 17th, 2022. It is available for pre-ordering via willofthepeople.muse.mu and is set to be released on August 26th, 2022.\nMatt reportedly said, to one of the fans after one of the London Apollo charity gigs, in May of 2022, that they intend to release two more songs before the album drops. A day after the second gig, on May 11th, Apple Music began to show the track duration for the title song, while a few days later, on May 13th, a release date for the song was set up for it on Amazon.[25] This led fans to speculate, that Will of the People would be the next single from the album. The song was later leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of June 1st was announced a day later, on May 27th.\nAfter being played on every gig of the Will of the People Summer Festivals Tour in June & July of 2022, it was announced by Muse on July 13th, 2022, that Kill or Be Killed would be the next song to be released from the album. It was released on July 21st, 2022, at 3PM BST.[26] This is also the last single before the album drop.\nDue to the fact that some people were able to get hold of the album earlier, on August 22nd, short snippets (phone recordings) of the unreleased songs from the album were leaked on Twitter, exception being We Are Fucking Fucked.[27] A day later, on August 23rd, the fifth single was announced by Muse, being You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. The single, and it's music video, are due to be released on August 26th, together with the album.\nOn August 1st, 2022, it was announced, that Will of the People would also be releasing as an NFT, available on the platform called \"Serenade\".[28] Limited to 1000 copies, it is the first new music format to be charted in the UK since 2015, when music streaming data started counting in the charts, alongside CD, LP and download sales. The NFT cover art is slightly different to the standard one, featuring a purple/blue colour scheme, instead of the orange/blue one, and also featuring Muse's signatures on the digital cover itself.\nOn November 24th, 2022, it was announced by Muse that a new single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On), featuring Italian singer, Elisa Toffoli would be released the next day.\nOn December 9th, 2022, Ghosts (How Can I Move On) was announced to have a second single, featuring French singer, Mylène Farmer and was released simultaneously.\nCritical Reception\nAfter the release, Metacritic scored the album in 71 out of 100, indicating the generally positive and favourable reviews. It was also commercially successful to become the Muse's seventh UK No.1 album. NME described the ninth album as their \"best music in these years\" and more respectable than their previous awkward trend-chasing album \"Simulation Theory\"[29]. Won't Stand Down and Kill or Be Killed have been appointed as the greatest sounds of all Muse's track by some mainstream critics, praising the styles and bringing the best composition into this album, implying those two tracks is going to be the new Stockholm Syndrome\nCritic also spotted the last track, We Are Fucking Fucked, as a perfect closer to highlighting the straightforward lyrics that deliver the powerful chorus, which is giving a throwback to Showbiz and Black Holes and Revelations era.\nThe album was well-received amongst critics, with Kerrang rating it 4/5[30], and Riff Magazine rating it 9/10[31]. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock Magazine also rated the album 9/10,[32] while Record Collector rated Will of the People with four stars and Gigwise gave the album a score of 8/10.[33]\nArtwork & Design\nWith Jesse Lee Stout back as their creative director, all the design and creative elements from the live shows, the music videos, and the rest of the art, are again intertwined with each other, like during Simulaiton Theory. The first design element of the album was the monogram (shown in the picture), consisting of letters \"W\", \"O\", \"T\" and \"P\". It first appeared on the single artwork for Won't Stand Down.and was already speculated at that time, that the monogram might be linked to the album name. The monogram makes appearances throughout the entirety of the album era.\nThe artwork, made by Portuguese digital artist Tiago Marinho, is set somewhere in a post-apocalyptic city, located in the middle of some desert (the design is very similar to the post-apocalyptic London, shown on the Sing for Absolution single artwork), and shows large demolished statues of the band's heads, with a group of rioters, later revealed to be the \"masked hackers\", standing next to them. The character of this \"masked hacker\", also dubbed as \"Will\" (hailing from the album's name), wears a reflective mask, which, like the monogram, also appears throughout the entire album cycle.\nOn the cover, each of the three demolished heads has graffiti sprayed all over them. These include the WOTP monograms scattered on each of the heads, aswel as names of songs. Other words written as graffiti include \"Die\" and \"Fuck off\" on Matt's head, both lines from the songs. Dom's head also includes \"IX\" written on it in Roman numerals, standing for the album being their ninth one. This is the first artwork since Black Holes and Revelations to not feature the Muse logo, or the album name on the art itself. It is also the second album artwork in a row / second main album artwork alltogether, to feature the bands' faces.\nThe story behind the album artwork is represented in the music video for the single, Will of the People.\nTouring\nOn March 20th, 2022, several fans have spotted graffiti and stickers with the, then unknown monogram, in and around the Shepherd's Bush Empire area in the Shepherd's Bush district of London, UK. It was unknown what exactly this meant at the time. Some have suggested that it was just a marketing campaign, while others have suggested a surprise show was going to take place soon.[34][35][36] Two fundraising concerts, in support of the album, were announced a week after the graffiti started to appear, on March 28th, which took place on May 9th and May 10th, at London's Eventim Apollo. Muse supported War Child & Médecins Sans Frontières on night one, and The Big Issue on night two.[37] Prior to the two shows, a very small gig, kept in complete secrecy, was performed on April 7th, 2022, at Exeter's Cavern Club. The gig was recorded for \"Jim Beam's Welcome Sessions\".\nThe Will of the People Festivals Tour was the first largest tour of the album era. It took place between summer and winter of 2022. The band headlined festivals across Europe, with an additional few gigs on U.S. festivals. The show itself, at times, loosely resembled that of Simulation Theory World Tour's, having a large Murph-inspired inflatable figure on stage, overlooking the band and the crowd, and \"The Power Glove\" returning. During the festivals tour, a smaller tour, called the Will Of The People Theatre Tour, was announced in June of 2022. On it, Muse were performing in smaller venues across Europe and the USA. Some of them haven't seen Muse perform live in almost 20 years. The tour took place during the main legs of the festivals tour, in October 2022.\nA bigger headlining tour is currently taking place, including both indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The tour began in Mexico in January of 2023, headed to North America in the spring and Europe in the summer, before finishing off in Kuala Lumpur in August of 2023.\nTracklist\nCD/Digital\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nVinyl\nSide A (One)\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B (Two)\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nCassette\nSide A\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nWill of the People gallery\nPersonnel\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy - Vocals, backing vocals, crowd vocals (tracks 1, 10), guitar, guitarviol (tracks 3 & 4), keyboards, piano, synth programming, production, art direction\n- Chris Wolstenholme - Bass, backing vocals, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\n- Dominic Howard - Drums, percussion, drum programming, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\nAdditional performers\n- Elle Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Bing Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Caris Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Ernie Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Buster Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Teddi Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff - Additional production, engineering, mixing (track 7)\n- Adrian Bushby - Additional engineering (track 7)\n- Joe Devenney - Engineering assistant\n- Serban Ghenea - Mixing (tracks 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Bryce Bordone - Mixing engineer (tracs 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Dan Lancaster - Mixing (track 4)\n- Rhys May - Mixing assistant (track 4)\n- Chris Whitemyer - Technical assistant\n- Paul Warren - Technical assistant\n- Andy Maxwell - Abbey Road assistance\n- Tommy Bosustow - Abbey Road assistance\n- Chris Gehringer - Mastering\nArt\n- Jesse Lee Stout - Creative direction, artwork (gatefold)\n- Tiago Marinho - Artwork (front cover, gatefold, NFT cover)\n- Andrea “Waarp” Marcias - Artwork (back cover, poster art, LP side A)\n- Miko del Rosario - Artwork (LP side B)\n- Gabriella Russo - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Tyrone Yarde - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Nick Fancher - Photography\nNinth album recording gallery\n\"Might as well!

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\nDéveloppement\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\nL'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\nThèmes\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\nSonorités\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques. Il s'agit de l'album le moins électronique des dernières décennies de la discographie du groupe. Un seul morceau, Verona, est principalement électronique.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nRemove ads\nBackground and recording\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nRemove ads\nPromotion and release\nSummarize\nPerspective\nThe first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nRemove ads\nComposition\nMusically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\nSummarize\nPerspective\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nRemove ads\nCommercial performance\nIn the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nRemove ads\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\nPersonnel\nSummarize\nPerspective\n|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nRemove ads\nCharts\nSummarize\nPerspective\nRemove ads\nCertifications\nReferences\nWikiwand - on\nSeamless Wikipedia browsing.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\nAchtergrond\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\nWill of the People World Tour\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband.

The song is intended to be a \"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \"[takes] it seriously.\"[8]\nMusic video\neditThe music video for \"Will of the People\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \"Will of the People\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\nThe music video for \"Will of the People\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\".[4]\nPersonnel\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\nCharts\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\nReferences\nedit- ^ \"WOTP August 26th.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nBackground and recording\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nPromotion and release\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nComposition\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\n|---|---|\n| Source | Rating |\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\n| Review scores | |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | [32] |\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\n| DIY | [34] |\n| Gigwise | [35] |\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\n| NME | [38] |\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nCommercial performance\n[edit]In the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nTrack listing\n[edit]All tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\n| No. | Title | Length |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | \"Will of the People\" | 3:18 |\n| 2. | \"Compliance\" | 4:10 |\n| 3. | \"Liberation\" | 3:06 |\n| 4. | \"Won't Stand Down\" | 3:29 |\n| 5. | \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" | 3:36 |\n| 6. | \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" | 3:00 |\n| 7. | \"Kill or Be Killed\" | 5:00 |\n| 8. | \"Verona\" | 4:56 |\n| 9. | \"Euphoria\" | 3:23 |\n| 10. | \"We Are Fucking Fucked\" | 3:36 |\n| Total length: | 37:40 |\nPersonnel\n[edit]|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nCharts\n[edit]\nWeekly charts[edit]\n|\nYear-end charts[edit]\n|\nCertifications\n[edit]| Region | Certification | Certified units/sales |\n|---|---|---|\n| France (SNEP)[86] | Platinum | 100,000‡ |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[87] | Gold | 100,000‡ |\n|\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Instagram\".\n- ^ a b Moore, Sam (16 May 2022). \"Matt Bellamy says Muse's 'Will Of The People' is \"a greatest hits album – of new songs\"\".

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\nTracce\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nFormazione\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\n- Gruppo\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Produzione\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\n- Andrea \"Waarp\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\nClassifiche\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\n|---|---|\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\nNote\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\nAccording to Muse, \"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[5]\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \"Best-Of Album\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \"RTL 2\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\nBackground\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\", adding \"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\".\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\nRecording\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \"totally resetting\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely. Producer Aleks Von Korff, who previously worked with Muse as an engineer on Simulation Theory, and produced Bellamy's solo material - songs like Tomorrow's World - also posted a picture from Red Room during that time, with the wooden Kawai piano.\nBetween April and June 2021, the band took a break from recording, to work on a remix of Origin of Symmetry. In early June, Matt and Dom joined Chris in the UK, continuing work on the album.[16] With the entire band back together in person, recording continued at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2021. The band were also joined by Muse's long-time engineer, Adrian Bushby, who posted a picture of him and Howard at Abbey Road Studios tracking drums.[17] This makes the upcoming album the second LP to be partially recorded at Abbey Road, after 20 years, when Origin of Symmetry was recorded at the facility. The album appears to have also been partially recorded at RAK Studios at the end of 2021, with Tre Cool from Green Day mentioned meeting up with Muse during their stay at the studio whilst recording their album, Saviors.[18]\nOn December 1st, 2021, Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer at Sterling Sound Studios posted a picture of Bellamy and Howard sitting on a couch, with the entire album at the mastering stage during that time. [19]\nRelease\nOn December 25th, 2021, Bellamy made up for the lack of a muse.mu Christmas present with a short livestream from his Tesla, on Muse's Instagram profile, showcasing part of Won't Stand Down. The 60 second stream was then screen-recorded by a few people, with copyright bots deleting the posts, hinting at the song being near its release. Matt's minute-long stream can be listened to here. The then-approaching release of the song was teased once again on Muse's New Years Eve Instagram post, when they wrote a caption saying \"Looking forward to WSD. We'll see you on the other side!\", before quickly replacing \"WSD\" with \"2022\". Won't Stand Down was subsequently announced a week later, on January 7th, 2022, on Muse's social media[21], with wontstanddown.muse.mu spotted being online a day earlier. Together with it also came the single artwork and a new promo image of the band. The song was released on January 13th, 2022, on digital platforms.\nAlmost two months later, on March 2nd, 2022, Bellamy posted an Instagram story in which he went over the guitar tuning for Won't Stand Down, while mentioning that a second heavy song will appear on the album.[22]\nOn March 9th, 2022, Muse posted a short, half-minute album teaser video on their YouTube, simply titled \"MUSE\", which depicts statues of the band's heads being torn down by a group of rioters in the middle of a desert, while wearing mirror masks from the Won't Stand Down music video, with a choir of Matts chanting the line \"The Will of the People\", name of the album and title track, with album artwork displayed at the very end of the video.[23]\nTwo days later, on March 11th, 2022, it was discovered by Muse fans that the index code from wontstanddown.muse.mu, contains basic album info, including the tracklist and anagrams for each song which will appear on the album. The same day, Muse announced a new song/single, Compliance. The song, and its music video, leaked on March 15th through Vimeo, before being deleted from the platform on the same day. A day later, anagrams from the wontstanddown index code were also resolved, leaking song titles and the tracklist. Compliance's music video was announced together with the album name on March 16th[24].\nThe album's release date has finally been announced, together with the release of Compliance, on March 17th, 2022. It is available for pre-ordering via willofthepeople.muse.mu and is set to be released on August 26th, 2022.\nMatt reportedly said, to one of the fans after one of the London Apollo charity gigs, in May of 2022, that they intend to release two more songs before the album drops. A day after the second gig, on May 11th, Apple Music began to show the track duration for the title song, while a few days later, on May 13th, a release date for the song was set up for it on Amazon.[25] This led fans to speculate, that Will of the People would be the next single from the album. The song was later leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of June 1st was announced a day later, on May 27th.\nAfter being played on every gig of the Will of the People Summer Festivals Tour in June & July of 2022, it was announced by Muse on July 13th, 2022, that Kill or Be Killed would be the next song to be released from the album. It was released on July 21st, 2022, at 3PM BST.[26] This is also the last single before the album drop.\nDue to the fact that some people were able to get hold of the album earlier, on August 22nd, short snippets (phone recordings) of the unreleased songs from the album were leaked on Twitter, exception being We Are Fucking Fucked.[27] A day later, on August 23rd, the fifth single was announced by Muse, being You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. The single, and it's music video, are due to be released on August 26th, together with the album.\nOn August 1st, 2022, it was announced, that Will of the People would also be releasing as an NFT, available on the platform called \"Serenade\".[28] Limited to 1000 copies, it is the first new music format to be charted in the UK since 2015, when music streaming data started counting in the charts, alongside CD, LP and download sales. The NFT cover art is slightly different to the standard one, featuring a purple/blue colour scheme, instead of the orange/blue one, and also featuring Muse's signatures on the digital cover itself.\nOn November 24th, 2022, it was announced by Muse that a new single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On), featuring Italian singer, Elisa Toffoli would be released the next day.\nOn December 9th, 2022, Ghosts (How Can I Move On) was announced to have a second single, featuring French singer, Mylène Farmer and was released simultaneously.\nCritical Reception\nAfter the release, Metacritic scored the album in 71 out of 100, indicating the generally positive and favourable reviews. It was also commercially successful to become the Muse's seventh UK No.1 album. NME described the ninth album as their \"best music in these years\" and more respectable than their previous awkward trend-chasing album \"Simulation Theory\"[29]. Won't Stand Down and Kill or Be Killed have been appointed as the greatest sounds of all Muse's track by some mainstream critics, praising the styles and bringing the best composition into this album, implying those two tracks is going to be the new Stockholm Syndrome\nCritic also spotted the last track, We Are Fucking Fucked, as a perfect closer to highlighting the straightforward lyrics that deliver the powerful chorus, which is giving a throwback to Showbiz and Black Holes and Revelations era.\nThe album was well-received amongst critics, with Kerrang rating it 4/5[30], and Riff Magazine rating it 9/10[31]. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock Magazine also rated the album 9/10,[32] while Record Collector rated Will of the People with four stars and Gigwise gave the album a score of 8/10.[33]\nArtwork & Design\nWith Jesse Lee Stout back as their creative director, all the design and creative elements from the live shows, the music videos, and the rest of the art, are again intertwined with each other, like during Simulaiton Theory. The first design element of the album was the monogram (shown in the picture), consisting of letters \"W\", \"O\", \"T\" and \"P\". It first appeared on the single artwork for Won't Stand Down.and was already speculated at that time, that the monogram might be linked to the album name. The monogram makes appearances throughout the entirety of the album era.\nThe artwork, made by Portuguese digital artist Tiago Marinho, is set somewhere in a post-apocalyptic city, located in the middle of some desert (the design is very similar to the post-apocalyptic London, shown on the Sing for Absolution single artwork), and shows large demolished statues of the band's heads, with a group of rioters, later revealed to be the \"masked hackers\", standing next to them. The character of this \"masked hacker\", also dubbed as \"Will\" (hailing from the album's name), wears a reflective mask, which, like the monogram, also appears throughout the entire album cycle.\nOn the cover, each of the three demolished heads has graffiti sprayed all over them. These include the WOTP monograms scattered on each of the heads, aswel as names of songs. Other words written as graffiti include \"Die\" and \"Fuck off\" on Matt's head, both lines from the songs. Dom's head also includes \"IX\" written on it in Roman numerals, standing for the album being their ninth one. This is the first artwork since Black Holes and Revelations to not feature the Muse logo, or the album name on the art itself. It is also the second album artwork in a row / second main album artwork alltogether, to feature the bands' faces.\nThe story behind the album artwork is represented in the music video for the single, Will of the People.\nTouring\nOn March 20th, 2022, several fans have spotted graffiti and stickers with the, then unknown monogram, in and around the Shepherd's Bush Empire area in the Shepherd's Bush district of London, UK. It was unknown what exactly this meant at the time. Some have suggested that it was just a marketing campaign, while others have suggested a surprise show was going to take place soon.[34][35][36] Two fundraising concerts, in support of the album, were announced a week after the graffiti started to appear, on March 28th, which took place on May 9th and May 10th, at London's Eventim Apollo. Muse supported War Child & Médecins Sans Frontières on night one, and The Big Issue on night two.[37] Prior to the two shows, a very small gig, kept in complete secrecy, was performed on April 7th, 2022, at Exeter's Cavern Club. The gig was recorded for \"Jim Beam's Welcome Sessions\".\nThe Will of the People Festivals Tour was the first largest tour of the album era. It took place between summer and winter of 2022. The band headlined festivals across Europe, with an additional few gigs on U.S. festivals. The show itself, at times, loosely resembled that of Simulation Theory World Tour's, having a large Murph-inspired inflatable figure on stage, overlooking the band and the crowd, and \"The Power Glove\" returning. During the festivals tour, a smaller tour, called the Will Of The People Theatre Tour, was announced in June of 2022. On it, Muse were performing in smaller venues across Europe and the USA. Some of them haven't seen Muse perform live in almost 20 years. The tour took place during the main legs of the festivals tour, in October 2022.\nA bigger headlining tour is currently taking place, including both indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The tour began in Mexico in January of 2023, headed to North America in the spring and Europe in the summer, before finishing off in Kuala Lumpur in August of 2023.\nTracklist\nCD/Digital\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nVinyl\nSide A (One)\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B (Two)\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nCassette\nSide A\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nWill of the People gallery\nPersonnel\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy - Vocals, backing vocals, crowd vocals (tracks 1, 10), guitar, guitarviol (tracks 3 & 4), keyboards, piano, synth programming, production, art direction\n- Chris Wolstenholme - Bass, backing vocals, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\n- Dominic Howard - Drums, percussion, drum programming, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\nAdditional performers\n- Elle Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Bing Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Caris Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Ernie Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Buster Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Teddi Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff - Additional production, engineering, mixing (track 7)\n- Adrian Bushby - Additional engineering (track 7)\n- Joe Devenney - Engineering assistant\n- Serban Ghenea - Mixing (tracks 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Bryce Bordone - Mixing engineer (tracs 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Dan Lancaster - Mixing (track 4)\n- Rhys May - Mixing assistant (track 4)\n- Chris Whitemyer - Technical assistant\n- Paul Warren - Technical assistant\n- Andy Maxwell - Abbey Road assistance\n- Tommy Bosustow - Abbey Road assistance\n- Chris Gehringer - Mastering\nArt\n- Jesse Lee Stout - Creative direction, artwork (gatefold)\n- Tiago Marinho - Artwork (front cover, gatefold, NFT cover)\n- Andrea “Waarp” Marcias - Artwork (back cover, poster art, LP side A)\n- Miko del Rosario - Artwork (LP side B)\n- Gabriella Russo - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Tyrone Yarde - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Nick Fancher - Photography\nNinth album recording gallery\n\"Might as well!

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\nDéveloppement\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\nL'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\nThèmes\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\nSonorités\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques. Il s'agit de l'album le moins électronique des dernières décennies de la discographie du groupe. Un seul morceau, Verona, est principalement électronique. Le reste de l'album alterne des chansons rock, glam rock, nu metal ou encore acoustique au piano. En avril 2021, le batteur Dominic Howard déclare que l'album « sonne lourd »[19]. Won't Stand Down, le premier extrait de l'album a des sonorités rock et Heavy metal[20].\nListe des pistes\n[modifier | modifier le code]| No | Titre | Durée | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:29 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:37 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 4:59 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:57 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:26 | |||||||\n| 37:35 |\nFormats de l'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]La liste des titres est dévoilée le 17 mars 2022 lors de l'annonce officielle de l'album et de la sortie du single \"Compliance\" le même jour.

Elle a été réalisée par le réalisateur anglais Jeremi Durand. Elle met en scène les membres du groupe grimés de masques interprétés par six comédiens, trois pour les personnages enfants de Muse et trois pour les personnages adultes.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nRemove ads\nBackground and recording\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nRemove ads\nPromotion and release\nSummarize\nPerspective\nThe first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nRemove ads\nComposition\nMusically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\nSummarize\nPerspective\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nRemove ads\nCommercial performance\nIn the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nRemove ads\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\nPersonnel\nSummarize\nPerspective\n|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nRemove ads\nCharts\nSummarize\nPerspective\nRemove ads\nCertifications\nReferences\nWikiwand - on\nSeamless Wikipedia browsing.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\nAchtergrond\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\nWill of the People World Tour\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\nOntvangst\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \"Generally favorable reviews\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\nNummers\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\nBezetting\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\n- Dominic Howard – drums\nHitnoteringen\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\nExterne links\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

The song is intended to be a \"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \"[takes] it seriously.\"[8]\nMusic video\neditThe music video for \"Will of the People\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \"Will of the People\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\nThe music video for \"Will of the People\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\".[4]\nPersonnel\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\nCharts\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\nReferences\nedit- ^ \"WOTP August 26th.

The song's name has been \"officially\" leaked on March 14th, 2022 via the JSON output from wontstanddown.muse.mu, which contains basic album info. In late May of 2022, Apple Music began showing the track length of the song in the album playlist, while Amazon set up a release date of June the 1st. The song itself got leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of the single, being June 1st, was announced a day later.\nWill Of The People has previously been teased by Muse through a couple of short clips, on YouTube and Instagram, revealing the album's name. Upon the album announcement, Warner described it as a track that \"brings playful provocation to a dystopian glam-rocker\"[2]\nAccording to Matt, the song is \"like a populist parody, almost the antithesis to Uprising\", adding \"Whereas ‘Uprising’ was almost populist but taking it seriously, ‘Will Of The People’ is almost, ‘Do we know that we’re stupid now? Do we know how silly this sounds and looks?’ Inside of me, there’s always been this little bit of a conflict between the desire for direct democracy and a bit more actual power to the people, but then at the same time realising that sometimes the people can be mad… Because they’ve had no voice for so long, populism ends up becoming distorted and strange and spiting everything. People end up spiting things just because they don’t have any fucking say.\".[3]\nInstrumentation\nThe track starts out with a looping crowd, chanting the line \"The Will of the People\". The same loop appears throughout the song. The track itself is based around guitar, bass and drums, with some guitar-synth layering, which is especially noticeable during the last part. The song also features heavy use of roto-toms during the bridge part. It also features a lot of \"ooh\"s and \"woah\"s throughout the song, aswel as a high-pitched scream, at around 2 minutes and 42 seconds. The choir consists of around 150 audio tracks, all of which were put together in remote, due to all the lockdowns throughout the pandemic.[4]\nStylistically, the song is reminiscent of songs such as Uprising, Psycho and Supermassive Black Hole, featuring a similar swing-rhythm and elements of glam-rock and a punchy 50s Elvis rockabilly. The looping choir has been compared to \"The Beautiful People\" by Marilyn Manson and the songs structure has been compared to that of Green Day, sounding like 'East Jesus Nowhere'. It's also been compared to Pressure and New Kind of Kick, having the same \"rock'n'roll\" feel with the saturated vocals. The song runs in A-Major and at a tempo of 130BPM.\nThe rough layout of the riff, which appears in the pre-chorus of the song, extends all the way back to 2019, when it was played by Matt as an improv riff after Unsustainable, during the Simulation Theory Tour.\nWill of the People is one of three songs on the album to feature Jeff Buckley's Telecaster. It is used for the high bluesy leads during the choruses.\nMusic Video\nLike the song itself, the music video was also used in the teaser, following the album reveal in March of 2022. The video itself tells the story of how the heads got torn down during a riot, which can be seen on the album artwork.\nMore here.\nTrivia\nFollowing the release of the music video, Muse posted the official lyrics under the YouTube video, but similar to other lyrical mistakes in the past (such as the various misprints in the Origin of Symmetry sleeve notes), the official lyrics contain two errors. As confirmed by Aleks Von Korff on Reddit, a line from the first verse is written as “Don't need a goon to flood with devotion”, when Matt sings ”Don't need a gun to flirt with devotion”[5], while a line from the second verse, written as “We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces” is in fact “your nation”.\nThe chants/crowd vocals are not only sung by Matt Bellamy. Instead, they are sung by the entire band, together with Elle, Bing Bellamy, Chris's wife Caris and his kids, Ernie, Buster, Teddi, Tabitha and Indiana.\nLive\nPerformed live as an intro to the shows, it features a slightly extended guitar chugging intro. It was first performed live on June 4th, 2022.\nMore here.\nLyrics\nOfficial lyrics as posted by Muse, however these lyrics do contain errors as noted above.\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nLet’s push the emperors into the ocean, Don’t need a goon to flood with devotion, With every hour our number increases We’ll smash your institutions to pieces\nWe need a transformation One we all can see We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nFree your sons and unlock your daughters We’ll throw the baby out with the bath water With every second our anger increases We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces\nWe need a transmutation One we all conceive We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the sheeple, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nWelcome to the desecration, baby We'll build up you right up and we'll tear you down Welcome to the celebration, baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nReferences\n- ↑ https://wontstanddown.muse.mu/api/v1/catalogue/new/\n- ↑ https://themusicuniverse.com/muse-announces-will-people/\n- ↑ https://www.nme.com/big-reads/muse-cover-interview-2022-will-of-the-people-3243209\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CeRBJolg96L/\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/v3wydc/are_these_the_real_lyrics_or_did_apple_music/ib2fui1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3",

Four gigs were announced in total, all in the UK and all outdoor stadium gigs. As expected, more tour dates were announced throughout the following months, leading up to the tour itself. Bellamy mentioned, in an interview with Zane Lowe in August of 2022, that the tour would take place between January and July of 2023, starting in Mexico, continuing in the U.S. and Canada, and finishing in Europe.[1]\nMexico\nMexican dates were announced on October 7th, 2022. The tour included stops at Monterrey's Estadio Banorte, Guadalajara's Arena VFG and Mexico City's Foro Sol, spreading over two dates, on both 22nd and 23rd of January. The additional date in Mexico City, on 23rd, was announced on October 27th, 2022.\nThe short Mexican leg took place before the U.S. legs.\nUnited States & Canada\nTaking place after the short Mexican leg, U.S. and Canada legs exclusively featured indoor shows, with the only exception being the gig at Shaky Knees festival in Atlanta. Most tour dates were announced on September 29th, 2022. Two additional gigs in Montreal and Quebec were announced on October 6th, while additional gigs in St. Louis and Oakland were announced on October 17th.\nThe tour featured two legs and one \"lone\" show. The first leg began at Chicago's United Center on February 25th, and ended at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center on March 19th. The second leg started with the show at Phoenix's Desert Diamond Arena on April 2nd, ending with a gig at Salt Lake City's Vivint Smart Home Arena. The final show in the U.S. took place on May 6th, at the afforementioned Shaky Knees festival.\nEurope\nStadium gigs\nAs mentioned above, the first gigs of the tour that were announced were the UK gigs. These took place in Plymouth's Home Park on May 27th, Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium on June 20th, Glasgow's Bellahouston Park on June 23rd and Milton Keynes's National Bowl on June 25th. The rest of the tour was announced afterwards. Additional European dates have been announced on January 20th, 2023, including the first show of the tour in Spain, in Santander's El Sardinero on July 4th, and a gig at Nancy's Zénith amphitheatre on July 6th, where they be played a headlining show, as part of the Nancy Open Air festival.\nThe rest of the European dates were announced soon afterwards. The European features Muse's first shows in the cities of Wiener Neustadt, Austria and Santander, Spain. Additionally, the show at Milton Keynes's National Bowl was Muse's first live show at the site. The last time Muse were at Milton Keynes before, was during the rehearsals for The Resistance stadium tour, in 2010. Additionally, Muse played in the city of The Hague, Netherlands after almost 23 years, and Lyon, France after about a decade.\nThe European tour featured an indoor production, scaled for an outdoor gig, and included both stadium and festival shows.\nArena gigs\nOn June 26th, the band announced indoor arena gigs for the UK and Ireland in autumn, with Nova Twins supporting.[2] The gigs announced are set to take place in Dublin's 3Arena on September 27th, Manchester's AO Arena on September 29th and London's The O2 on October 1st and 2nd.\nTravel packages\nThree travel packages were available to buy for three dates off of the European leg of the tour; Cologne (June 9th), Paris (July 8th) and Milan (July 22nd). Each travel package included, together with two tickets, a two-night stay at a hotel (king or twin bed rooms options are available). Hotels which were included are Cologne's Pullman, Paris's Marriott Ambassador and Milan's Marriott. An optional third night add-on was also included in each package, for additional cost. Additionally, two exclusive posters, commemorating Muse's performance at each venue in the city (RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Stade de France in Paris and San Siro in Milan) were included in each travel package, as were on-site hosts, and, for the Cologne gig, a roundtrip fare on the metro to the stadium.\nMore on the travel packages can be seen here.\nAsia\nAfter being teased on February 16th by the band on social media, the band announced the only Asian gig of the tour in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, on February 22nd. The open-air gig took place at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium on 29th July 2023.[3][4] The show marked the first Muse gig that took place in the country since 2007.\nSaudi Arabia\nIn 2024, Muse took time off touring to focus on families and solo projects. Despite that, two gigs took place in Saudi Arabia in December; The first one in Abu Dhabi, at F1, and another one, in Riyadh, at the Banban Festival.\nSupporting acts\nThje first support act to be announced were Royal Blood, who opened for Muse during the European open-air leg (exceptions being the Nancy and Glasgow gigs, aswell as festivals). For the U.S. shows, Evanescence were announced as the main opening act. Additional support acts for U.S. shows were announced on November 9th, 2022; One Ok Rock supported Muse during the first half of the U.S. leg (between Chicago and Philadelphia gigs), while Highly Suspect will be supporting Muse during the second half of the U.S. leg (between the Phoenix and Salt Lake City gigs).[5] On January 13th, 2023, The Warning were announced as the support act for the Mexico gigs.[6]\nOn March 22nd, both The Warning and One Ok Rock were announced as additional support acts for select European dates. The Warning supported Muse on the U.K. leg (plus one stop in Lyon, France), while One Ok Rock supported them on the rest of the European leg (excluding festivals, and the Glasgow gig). Joining the two is Twin Atlantic, who opened together with The Warning on the afforementioned Bellahouston Park gig in Glasgow.[7] A support change was made for the gig in Bern, Switzerland, as One Ok Rock couldn't perform at due to unforeseen circumstances; Replacing them was Emilie Zoé. Kyoto Protocol were announced as the support act for the Kuala Lumpur gig only a few weeks before the show itself, on July 11th, 2023.\nOn June 26th, alongside the annoucement of the UK and Ireland indoor gigs, Nova Twins were announced to be supporting Muse on these gigs.[8]\nProduction\nAs with the previous large headlining tour, the Simulation Theory World Tour, this tour features indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The stage set-up in general is a hybrid between the 2022 festivals tour and the autumn theatre tour setups. It includes an inflatable rotating figure of Will the Hacker as a backdrop, together with a grid of light fixtures, similar to the one from the theatre tour. Joining Will the Hacker is a new figure nicknamed \"Baph\".\nThe festival setup (which was also used during the Mexican leg of the tour) bears more resemblance to the 2022 summer festivals setup, with the only major difference being an addition of the lighting grid, replacing the LED strip lights behind the band. An inflatable figure of Will is present throughout the entire show, including the encore, while the setlists themselves (exceptions being the Mexican shows) include no rotations, and are more akin to the 2022 summer festivals setlists\nThe indoor setup, which premiered at the North American leg, features a stage with transparent floor, allowing for it to be illuminated from below, with an addition of a larger B-stage, six moving glass panels with lights, hung above the band, more lights on the back-grid, and, as mentioned above, an inflatable figure named \"Baph\", joining \"Will\", getting inflated for the encore. Because of the differences, the setlists for the North American shows also got \"revamped\".\nThe stage for the European outdoor setup had the same core of elements as the indoor arena setup , with an addition of two stage wings on either side, aswell as larger LED screens on both sides of the stage, equipped with light fixtures. It also featured a longer runway to the B-stage, with the B-stage itself being slightly bigger than it was for the indoor shows. \"Will\" is now equipped with a LED screen inside of his mask, an exclusive to the stadium/headlining shows, as festivals still use the older and smaller version of the figure. The full outdoor set up was officially revealed on Muse's Instagram[9], a day prior to the first gig in Plymouth, on May 26th, after pictures and videos of the stage being set up surfaced on social media a few days before.[10]\nFor the Saudi Arabia gigs in 2024, the core of the production remained the same, however, the burning WOTP logo was ditched.\nShort tour documentaries\nA series of short documentaries was set to be released throughout the tour itself, shot and edited by Muse's WOTP tour photographer Johann Ramos (known as \"The Work of Jar\") and Centreline Films, posted on Muse's YouTube channel.\nSix documentaries have been released so far. The first one is a recap of the first leg of the tour in Mexico, the second one goes over the rehearsals, which took place in California's Ontario, aswell as the Chicago show. The third one looks back at week one of the U.S. leg of the tour, the fourth one talks about the homecoming Plymouth show, and week one of the European leg, can be seen here. The fifht one shows various clips and highlights from the European stadium tour. The sixth features Matt talking about Kill or Be Killed, while showing pre-show backstage footage.\nAverage Setlist\nDuring the January leg in Mexico, the setlist remained relatively unchaged from the shows off of the 2022 festivals tour. This changed with leg 1 in the U.S., starting in Chicago, in February, when the show was updated, in turn bringing in a new setlist format. This first indoor leg in the U.S. brought in live premieres of Verona and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental). STT Interstitials 1 and 3 returned as Simulation Theory Theme, which was played from tape, mashed up with [JFK], acting as an intro to Kill or Be Killed. Additionally, Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation version was played from tape, as an interstitial, before Compliance. Also returning after several years were Resistance, Undisclosed Desires and the shortened version of Isolated System. Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses) was also played, making this the second big headlining tour to feature Assassin, played in full since the Black Holes And Revelations Tour, with it previously being only played during The Drones World Tour 2015/16.\nWith the announcement of the Absolution XX Anniversary boxset in September of 2023, the band looks to have put an emphasis on songs off of the album during the indoor autumn leg in the UK and Ireland, with both Butterflies & Hurricanes and Apocalypse Please played on the first night of the leg in Dublin. Both songs were played for the first time in 6 years and 7 years respectively. During the leg, Stockholm Syndrome replaced Kill or Be Killed in its slot in Manchester. Space Dementia also made a return.\nThe setlist changed the most with the 2024 Saudi Arabia gigs, with the usual opener (Will ofthe People) replaced with the Simulation Theory Theme / JFK mashup (played from tape) and Won't Stand Down. Starlight was also chosen to replace Knights of Cydonia as a closer for the first time in 11 years.

Generally, the setlists for these shows were more or less the same to these of the Will of the People Festivals Tour.\n- With the start of the U.S. tour, the production was updated, in turn also changing the setlists - Scrambling songs on the setlist and changing its template, replacing The Gallery with Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Remix) and adding songs like Verona, The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental) and Isolated System to the sets.\n- A few gigs into the U.S. leg, Undisclosed Desires was put into rotation with Resistance.\n- Liberation was in rotation with Verona on double nights during the NA leg of the tour, which were only the second night of both Quebec City and Montreal. Verona was dropped for the UK indoor leg with Apocalypse Please and Space Dementia played in rotation in its place.\n- The Shaky Knees Festival gig featured a shorter setlist with a few changes compared to the indoor gig setlists; Thought Contagion was played earlier in the set, Isolated System was played before Supermassive Black Hole and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality)'s instrumental version and JFK / Simulation Theory Theme intro were ditched from the set. The same setlist was played at the NorthSide festival in Denmark.\n- For the stadium shows, Resistance and Undisclosed Desires were brought out of rotation and were both played at each show.\n- The stadium shows also featured less songs in the first rotation slot, these being Bliss and Map of the Problematique (with the latter only being played three times so far). Stockholm Syndrome joined the two at the Rome gig.\n- Showbiz was played instead of Knights of Cydonia at the Werchter Festival gig after technical issues meant the latter song couldn't be played. This made it the first gig in which all 9 studio albums were represented.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2024-12-13 | Banban (Soundstorm Festival) | Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |\n| 2024-12-08 | Du Arena (Formula 1 Grand Prix) | Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates |\n| 2023-11-04 | Foro Pegaso (Hell & Heaven Festival) | Toluca de Lerdo, Mexico |\n| 2023-10-02 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-10-01 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-09-29 | AO Arena | Manchester, UK |\n| 2023-09-27 | 3Arena | Dublin, Ireland |\n| 2023-07-29 | Bukit Kiara Equestrian Resort | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |\n| 2023-07-22 | Stadio Giuseppe Meazza | Milan, Italy |\n| 2023-07-18 | Stadio Olimpico | Rome, Italy |\n| 2023-07-15 | Stade Orange Vélodrome | Marseille, France |\n| 2023-07-12 | BernExpo Areal | Bern, Switzerland |\n| 2023-07-08 | Stade de France | Paris, France |\n| 2023-07-06 | Zénith de Nancy (Nancy Open Air) | Nancy, France |\n| 2023-07-04 | Campos de Sport de El Sardinero | Santander, Spain |\n| 2023-07-01 | Festivalpark Werchter (Rock Werchter) | Werchter, Belgium |\n| 2023-06-29 | Matmut Atlantique | Bordeaux, France |\n| 2023-06-25 | The National Bowl | Milton Keynes, UK |\n| 2023-06-23 | Bellahouston Park | Glasgow, UK |\n| 2023-06-20 | John Smith's Stadium | Huddersfield, UK |\n| 2023-06-18 | Flugplatz Neuhausen (Southside Festival) | Neuhausen ob Eck, Germany |\n| 2023-06-17 | Eichenring (Hurricane Festival) | Scheessel, Germany |\n| 2023-06-15 | Groupama Stadium | Lyon, France |\n| 2023-06-11 | Park 360 (Rock for People) | Hradec Králové, Czech Republic |\n| 2023-06-09 | RheinEnergieStadion | Cologne, Germany |\n| 2023-06-07 | Malieveld | The Hague, Netherlands |\n| 2023-06-03 | Stadion Wiener Neustadt | Wiener Neustadt, Austria |\n| 2023-06-01 | Eskelunden (NorthSide) | Århus, Denmark |\n| 2023-05-27 | Home Park | Plymouth, UK |\n| 2023-05-06 | Central Park (Shaky Knees Music Festival) | Atlanta, GA, USA |\n| 2023-04-20 | Vivint Arena | Salt Lake City, UT, USA |\n| 2023-04-18 | Climate Pledge Arena | Seattle, WA, USA |\n| 2023-04-16 | Moda Center | Portland, OR, USA |\n| 2023-04-14 | Oakland Arena | Oakland, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-12 | Honda Center | Anaheim, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-10 | Pechanga Arena | San Diego, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-08 | T-Mobile Arena | Las Vegas, NV, USA |\n| 2023-04-06 | Crypto.com Arena | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-04 | Ball Arena | Denver, CO, USA |\n| 2023-04-02 | Desert Diamond Arena | Phoenix, AZ, USA |\n| 2023-03-19 | Wells Fargo Center | Philadelphia, PA, USA |\n| 2023-03-17 | Madison Square Garden | New York City, NY, USA |\n| 2023-03-15 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-14 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-12 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-11 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-09 | Scotiabank Arena | Toronto, ON, Canada |\n| 2023-03-07 | Nationwide Arena | Columbus, OH, USA |\n| 2023-03-05 | Chaifetz Arena | St. Louis, MO, USA |\n| 2023-03-03 | Dickies Arena | Fort Worth, TX, USA |\n| 2023-03-02 | Toyota Center | Houston, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-28 | Moody Center | Austin, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-26 | Target Center | Minneapolis, MN, USA |\n| 2023-02-25 | United Center | Chicago, IL, USA |\n| 2023-01-23 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-22 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-20 | Arena V.F.G. | Guadalajara, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-18 | Estadio Banorte | Monterrey, Mexico |\nSee also\nReferences\n- ↑ https://youtu.be/AMvtyphl9rA?t=2297\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CpMk5jDBxEG/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1628321276896112641\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CnXcXiNNSFy/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1638587091020914713/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/Csuf6rlqKCS/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZn26TSifb/",

It was released on 21 July 2022 as the fourth single ahead of their ninth studio album Will of the People, having already debuted in live format during festival shows of their Will of the People World Tour. It was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.\nRelease history\n[edit]\"Kill or Be Killed\" was debuted in live format at the 4 June 2022 show of the Will of the People World Tour, at the Rock am Ring music festival in Germany, during which the previous single \"Will of the People\" also received its live debut. \"Kill or Be Killed\" was played as the first song of the encore, before the closing song \"Knights of Cydonia\", and without any official prior announcement from the band.[1]\n\"Kill or Be Killed\" was subsequently played at every following show of the tour, emerging as a fan favourite. On 14 July, Muse confirmed through social media that \"Kill or Be Killed\" would be released as the fourth single ahead of Will of the People one week later on 21 July 2022, with a thirty-second snippet of the studio version of the song becoming available to preview through TikTok later that day.[2]\nWriting and composition\n[edit]Prior to the live debut of \"Kill or Be Killed\", in an interview with Apple Music 1 on 17 March 2022, Matt Bellamy described \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"the best metal/prog track we've ever done\", featuring \"industrial-tinged, granite-heavy guitar riffs\".[3] Music journalists described \"Kill or Be Killed\" as progressive metal,[4][5] heavy metal,[6] alternative metal,[7] and metalcore.[8]\nFor the guitar solo, Bellamy combined a tapping technique with a DigiTech Whammy, a pitch-shifting pedal, to shift rapidly between octaves. He said, \"I'm plainly cheating in that solo ... It sounds like I’m doing insane arpeggios. I'm not a shredder at all. I've never been a very good shredder, but I found ways to cut corners.\"[9]\nCharts\n[edit]| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[10] | 81 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[11] | 80 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[12] | 20 |\n| US Rock Airplay (Billboard)[13] | 37 |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Shutler, Ali (5 June 2022). \"Watch Muse perform new song 'Kill Or Be Killed' as they kick off summer tour\".

At the end, it is revealed that three of the rioters are infact the \"dicators\" (the band), which appear to be rioting against themselves. In the words of Matt Bellamy, \"\"Will of the People\" is fictional story set in a fictional metaverse on a fictional planet ruled by a fictional authoritarian state run by a fictional algorithm manifested by a fictional data centre running a fictional bank printing a fictional currency controlling a fictional population occupying a fictional city containing a fictional apartment where a fictional man woke up one day and thought \"fuck this.\"\"[1]\nThe song's music video itself, being that of the title track, contains alot of elements which are seen in the album artwork. It was also previously used as a short teaser for the album announcement, in March of 2022.[2]\nAdditional information\nThe video was directed by Tom Teller and produced by Frame 48. The same production company also handled post-production and VFX for both the Simulation Theory Film and all of Simulation Theory's music videos, with Tom Teller as executive director on all projects. The visual performance was motion captured by parkour athlete, Didi Alaoui at one of the Tempest Freerunning Academies in the USA.\nThis is the first music video during the Will of the People era which isn't filmed in the 4:3 format.\nWill of the People Screenshots\nCredits\n- Studio: Frame48\n- Freerunning Facility: Tempest Freerunning Academy\n- Director: Tom Teller\n- Creative Director: Jesse Lee Stout\n- Executive Producers: Julian Conner, Seth Josephson, Tom Teller\n- Performance Capture Athlete: Didi Alaoui\n- FX Artist: Alvaro Moreira\n- CG Supervisor & Lead Artist: Enrique De la Garza\n- CG Artists: Steven Lee, Stephanie Buschhorn, Isaac Zuren\n- Rigger: Jarom Brand\n- Animators: Paolo Cogliati, Matheus Caetano\n- Assistant Editor: Michele Nagy\n- Compositors: Sai Prudhvi, Mahesh Kanneboina, Maryam Riahi, Sreedhar Krkumar\n- Colorist: Bryan Smaller\n- Sound Designer: Gerry Vazquez\n- Character Artists: Mariano Ruiz Manzano, Isaac Olander\n- Asset Artist: Juan Fer Bravo\n- Storyboard Artist: David Green",

This was the first tour of the Will of the People era, and first tour in three years, since the pandemic of …\nContent: Will of the People Festivals Tour\n| Gig nav | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Simulation Theory World Tour | ← | Will of the People Festivals Tour | → | Will of the People Theatre Tour |\nA tour, spread out throughout the entire second half of 2022, and the beginning of 2023, during which Muse played festivals in both Europe, and the United States. The Will of the People Festivals Tour took place between June 2022 and January 2023. This was the first tour of the Will of the People era, and first tour in three years, since the pandemic of 2020.\nInformation\nThe tour began one month after the WOTP promo gigs, and first gigs since 2019 alltogether, in Exeter's Cavern Club and London's Apollo gigs, on June 4th, 2022, with a performance at Rock am Ring in Germany. As mentioned above, this was the first major tour, supporting the album, Will of the People. The tour included Muse's debut performances at Nova Rock, Aftershock and Audacy Beach festivals, aswell as performances at the Isle of Wight, Eurockéennes and Rock in Rio Lisbon festivals, amongst others. The tour also included a special, more intimate invite-only gig, at the James B. Beam Distillery in Kentucky, when Muse played a gig as part of Jim Beam Welcome Sessions.\nWill of the People and Kill or Be Killed made their live debuts on the first leg of the tour, with Compliance and Won't Stand Down being played on the couple gigs before the tour. You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween made its debut on the second leg of the tour, in September. Nishe was brought back after 11 years, played before Madness, and also played in full for the first time since 2000. A Bellamy solo song, Behold, The Glove, returned, after last being present during the Simulation Theory World Tour in 2019, when it was played from tape as a short intro piece (then known as STT Interstitial 2). On this tour, the song was played in full, with the entire band.\nThe day before the first gig, on June 3rd, 2022, the entire tour's setlist template was leaked on Twitter.\nProduction\nThe show was, in some aspects, similar to the afforementioned previous tour. Similar to Murph the Robot, the tour featured its counterpart, a large inflatable \"masked hacker\" figure, nicknamed \"Will the Hacker\", which was set up on-stage behind the band, and was present throughout most of the show (excluding the fist few songs). It was revealed during Won't Stand Down. The main difference between Will the Hacker and Murph is that the hacker was a lot bigger and bulkier. It's made up of three separate parts: Two shoulders, sitting on each side of the head, which was attached to trussing, rotating left to right slightly. Behind the hacker were two thin walls of LED light strips, also attached to top trussing. Lights were used to illuminate the inflatable figure from different angles throughout the show.\nAlso similar to the Simulation Theory Tour was the use of The Power Glove. The difference, however, is, that, the new glove acted as an instrument, with a built-in smartphone, connected to the PA system, using a synthesizer app called \"NOISE\". Matt played Behold, The Glove and the synth intro of Uprising on the glove. While doing so, Bellamy wore an illuminating LED leather jacket, similar to the jacket worn during the previous tour.\nKeeping with the heavier style of the new songs, the gigs relied on heavy use of pyro, specifically, fire. The show opened with a large burning \"WOTP\" monogram logo, placed behind the band, while they play the song Will of the People. The fire can be re-ignited quickly at any given time, with the ability to lit up each letter separately. Fire machines are used throughout the rest of the show, during Won't Stand Down, Madness, Thought Contagion, Uprising, Kill or Be Killed and (later on during the tour) Knights of Cydonia.\nThree video interstitials, named \"Chant\", \"Parkour\" and \"Driving\" were played during the show. These included elements from Will of the People's music video. The \"Chant\" one was played before Will of the People, and showed the video of the stone heads being torn down, seen during the last part of the music video, and also in the album trailer, posted on Muse's YouTube channel. The \"Parkour\" one showed the rioter running and jumping over buildings, as seen during the music video's first part, and is played before Time Is Running Out. The \"Driving\" interstitial showed the vehicles from the music video being driven through the desert, and was played before Plug In Baby.\nWith Mercy being dropped from the setlists, Compliance took over as the song during which streamers are released.\nOn some dates, due to the logistics, some elements of the production weren't present on all gigs, or were swapped. This notably happened for the Lisbon gig at Rock in Rio, when the main production was headed to London, so the band were forced to use a minimal stage setup, which included replacing the figure of Will the Hacker with Murph the Robot, ditching the \"WOTP\" logo at the start, and changing the band's wardrobe. The same (or similar) minimal stage set-up was also present during the Telekom Street Gigs show in Cologne, Audacy Beach Festival in Fort Lauderdale and the iHeartRadio ALTer EGO in Los Angeles, while the burning logo itself didn't appear in Florence, at Firenze Rocks.\nAverage Setlist\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Pressure\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased\n- The Gallery\n- Compliance (w/ guitar)\n- Thought Contagion\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Nishe (shortened)\n- Madness\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nNotes\n- Map of the Problematique and Stockholm Syndrome share their outro riffs, being Duality, Calm Like a Bomb and the Unknown one, although they shuffle through them gig by gig.\n- Nishe was initially only played as a short 1-minuite snippet, but it was later extended to almost 2 minutes after the third show.\nExceptions\n- Citizen Erased was played at the Rock am Ring gig as an extra song after Madness while Map of the Problematique was played in the rotation slot.\n- For the first 4 shows of the tour, Thought Contagion was played between Supermassive Black Hole and Plug in Baby.\n- At the Isle of Wight Festival, Won't Stand Down was played after the rotation slot while Citizen Erased was played in said slot.\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween got its debut at Xacobeo Festival. It was played after Thought Contagion and replaced the MOTP/Stockholm Syndrome/Citizen Erased slot and was played there through September.\n- Tributing Queen Elizabeth II after her passing, \"God Save the Queen\" was played briefly at Xacobeo Festival, before Interlude.\n- Telekom Street Gigs, James B. Beam Distillery had notably shorter setlists, with Thought Contagion, Time Is Running Out, Nishe and Madness all being dropped with no replacement and some of the remaining songs were shuffled around. The only setlist difference between the two (other than the order of the songs) is that Behold, The Glove was played at the former while Minimum was played at the latter. The 2023 iHeartRadio gig at Los Angeles+s The Kia Forum had the shortest setlist of all shows, with just nine songs, being Will of the People, Hysteria, Won't Stand Down, Madness, Compliance, Supermassive Black Hole, Behold The Glove, Uprising and Starlight, which was the closer.\n- Aftershock Festival had a notably heavier setlist, with Stockholm Syndrome replacing Pressure, We Are Fucking Fucked replacing the summer rotation slot, New Born replacing Compliance, You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween replacing Thought Contagion, Minimum replacing Nishe and Madness being dropped with no replacement.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2023-01-14 | The Kia Forum (iHeartRadio ALTer EGO) | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2022-12-03 | Fort Lauderdale Beach (Audacy Beach Festival) | Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA |\n| 2022-10-09 | Discovery Park (Aftershock Festival) | Sacramento, CA, USA |\n| 2022-10-08 | James B.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nBackground and recording\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nPromotion and release\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nComposition\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\n|---|---|\n| Source | Rating |\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\n| Review scores | |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | [32] |\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\n| DIY | [34] |\n| Gigwise | [35] |\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\n| NME | [38] |\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nCommercial performance\n[edit]In the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nTrack listing\n[edit]All tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\n| No. | Title | Length |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | \"Will of the People\" | 3:18 |\n| 2. | \"Compliance\" | 4:10 |\n| 3. | \"Liberation\" | 3:06 |\n| 4. | \"Won't Stand Down\" | 3:29 |\n| 5. | \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" | 3:36 |\n| 6. | \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" | 3:00 |\n| 7. | \"Kill or Be Killed\" | 5:00 |\n| 8. | \"Verona\" | 4:56 |\n| 9. | \"Euphoria\" | 3:23 |\n| 10. | \"We Are Fucking Fucked\" | 3:36 |\n| Total length: | 37:40 |\nPersonnel\n[edit]|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nCharts\n[edit]\nWeekly charts[edit]\n|\nYear-end charts[edit]\n|\nCertifications\n[edit]| Region | Certification | Certified units/sales |\n|---|---|---|\n| France (SNEP)[86] | Platinum | 100,000‡ |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[87] | Gold | 100,000‡ |\n|\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Instagram\".\n- ^ a b Moore, Sam (16 May 2022). \"Matt Bellamy says Muse's 'Will Of The People' is \"a greatest hits album – of new songs\"\".

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\nTracce\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nFormazione\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\n- Gruppo\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Produzione\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\n- Andrea \"Waarp\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\nClassifiche\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\n|---|---|\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\nNote\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\nAccording to Muse, \"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[5]\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \"Best-Of Album\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \"RTL 2\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\nBackground\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\", adding \"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\".\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\nRecording\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \"totally resetting\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely. Producer Aleks Von Korff, who previously worked with Muse as an engineer on Simulation Theory, and produced Bellamy's solo material - songs like Tomorrow's World - also posted a picture from Red Room during that time, with the wooden Kawai piano.\nBetween April and June 2021, the band took a break from recording, to work on a remix of Origin of Symmetry. In early June, Matt and Dom joined Chris in the UK, continuing work on the album.[16] With the entire band back together in person, recording continued at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2021. The band were also joined by Muse's long-time engineer, Adrian Bushby, who posted a picture of him and Howard at Abbey Road Studios tracking drums.[17] This makes the upcoming album the second LP to be partially recorded at Abbey Road, after 20 years, when Origin of Symmetry was recorded at the facility. The album appears to have also been partially recorded at RAK Studios at the end of 2021, with Tre Cool from Green Day mentioned meeting up with Muse during their stay at the studio whilst recording their album, Saviors.[18]\nOn December 1st, 2021, Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer at Sterling Sound Studios posted a picture of Bellamy and Howard sitting on a couch, with the entire album at the mastering stage during that time. [19]\nRelease\nOn December 25th, 2021, Bellamy made up for the lack of a muse.mu Christmas present with a short livestream from his Tesla, on Muse's Instagram profile, showcasing part of Won't Stand Down. The 60 second stream was then screen-recorded by a few people, with copyright bots deleting the posts, hinting at the song being near its release. Matt's minute-long stream can be listened to here. The then-approaching release of the song was teased once again on Muse's New Years Eve Instagram post, when they wrote a caption saying \"Looking forward to WSD. We'll see you on the other side!\", before quickly replacing \"WSD\" with \"2022\". Won't Stand Down was subsequently announced a week later, on January 7th, 2022, on Muse's social media[21], with wontstanddown.muse.mu spotted being online a day earlier. Together with it also came the single artwork and a new promo image of the band. The song was released on January 13th, 2022, on digital platforms.\nAlmost two months later, on March 2nd, 2022, Bellamy posted an Instagram story in which he went over the guitar tuning for Won't Stand Down, while mentioning that a second heavy song will appear on the album.[22]\nOn March 9th, 2022, Muse posted a short, half-minute album teaser video on their YouTube, simply titled \"MUSE\", which depicts statues of the band's heads being torn down by a group of rioters in the middle of a desert, while wearing mirror masks from the Won't Stand Down music video, with a choir of Matts chanting the line \"The Will of the People\", name of the album and title track, with album artwork displayed at the very end of the video.[23]\nTwo days later, on March 11th, 2022, it was discovered by Muse fans that the index code from wontstanddown.muse.mu, contains basic album info, including the tracklist and anagrams for each song which will appear on the album. The same day, Muse announced a new song/single, Compliance. The song, and its music video, leaked on March 15th through Vimeo, before being deleted from the platform on the same day. A day later, anagrams from the wontstanddown index code were also resolved, leaking song titles and the tracklist. Compliance's music video was announced together with the album name on March 16th[24].\nThe album's release date has finally been announced, together with the release of Compliance, on March 17th, 2022. It is available for pre-ordering via willofthepeople.muse.mu and is set to be released on August 26th, 2022.\nMatt reportedly said, to one of the fans after one of the London Apollo charity gigs, in May of 2022, that they intend to release two more songs before the album drops. A day after the second gig, on May 11th, Apple Music began to show the track duration for the title song, while a few days later, on May 13th, a release date for the song was set up for it on Amazon.[25] This led fans to speculate, that Will of the People would be the next single from the album. The song was later leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of June 1st was announced a day later, on May 27th.\nAfter being played on every gig of the Will of the People Summer Festivals Tour in June & July of 2022, it was announced by Muse on July 13th, 2022, that Kill or Be Killed would be the next song to be released from the album. It was released on July 21st, 2022, at 3PM BST.[26] This is also the last single before the album drop.\nDue to the fact that some people were able to get hold of the album earlier, on August 22nd, short snippets (phone recordings) of the unreleased songs from the album were leaked on Twitter, exception being We Are Fucking Fucked.[27] A day later, on August 23rd, the fifth single was announced by Muse, being You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. The single, and it's music video, are due to be released on August 26th, together with the album.\nOn August 1st, 2022, it was announced, that Will of the People would also be releasing as an NFT, available on the platform called \"Serenade\".[28] Limited to 1000 copies, it is the first new music format to be charted in the UK since 2015, when music streaming data started counting in the charts, alongside CD, LP and download sales. The NFT cover art is slightly different to the standard one, featuring a purple/blue colour scheme, instead of the orange/blue one, and also featuring Muse's signatures on the digital cover itself.\nOn November 24th, 2022, it was announced by Muse that a new single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On), featuring Italian singer, Elisa Toffoli would be released the next day.\nOn December 9th, 2022, Ghosts (How Can I Move On) was announced to have a second single, featuring French singer, Mylène Farmer and was released simultaneously.\nCritical Reception\nAfter the release, Metacritic scored the album in 71 out of 100, indicating the generally positive and favourable reviews. It was also commercially successful to become the Muse's seventh UK No.1 album. NME described the ninth album as their \"best music in these years\" and more respectable than their previous awkward trend-chasing album \"Simulation Theory\"[29]. Won't Stand Down and Kill or Be Killed have been appointed as the greatest sounds of all Muse's track by some mainstream critics, praising the styles and bringing the best composition into this album, implying those two tracks is going to be the new Stockholm Syndrome\nCritic also spotted the last track, We Are Fucking Fucked, as a perfect closer to highlighting the straightforward lyrics that deliver the powerful chorus, which is giving a throwback to Showbiz and Black Holes and Revelations era.\nThe album was well-received amongst critics, with Kerrang rating it 4/5[30], and Riff Magazine rating it 9/10[31]. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock Magazine also rated the album 9/10,[32] while Record Collector rated Will of the People with four stars and Gigwise gave the album a score of 8/10.[33]\nArtwork & Design\nWith Jesse Lee Stout back as their creative director, all the design and creative elements from the live shows, the music videos, and the rest of the art, are again intertwined with each other, like during Simulaiton Theory. The first design element of the album was the monogram (shown in the picture), consisting of letters \"W\", \"O\", \"T\" and \"P\". It first appeared on the single artwork for Won't Stand Down.and was already speculated at that time, that the monogram might be linked to the album name. The monogram makes appearances throughout the entirety of the album era.\nThe artwork, made by Portuguese digital artist Tiago Marinho, is set somewhere in a post-apocalyptic city, located in the middle of some desert (the design is very similar to the post-apocalyptic London, shown on the Sing for Absolution single artwork), and shows large demolished statues of the band's heads, with a group of rioters, later revealed to be the \"masked hackers\", standing next to them. The character of this \"masked hacker\", also dubbed as \"Will\" (hailing from the album's name), wears a reflective mask, which, like the monogram, also appears throughout the entire album cycle.\nOn the cover, each of the three demolished heads has graffiti sprayed all over them. These include the WOTP monograms scattered on each of the heads, aswel as names of songs. Other words written as graffiti include \"Die\" and \"Fuck off\" on Matt's head, both lines from the songs. Dom's head also includes \"IX\" written on it in Roman numerals, standing for the album being their ninth one. This is the first artwork since Black Holes and Revelations to not feature the Muse logo, or the album name on the art itself. It is also the second album artwork in a row / second main album artwork alltogether, to feature the bands' faces.\nThe story behind the album artwork is represented in the music video for the single, Will of the People.\nTouring\nOn March 20th, 2022, several fans have spotted graffiti and stickers with the, then unknown monogram, in and around the Shepherd's Bush Empire area in the Shepherd's Bush district of London, UK. It was unknown what exactly this meant at the time. Some have suggested that it was just a marketing campaign, while others have suggested a surprise show was going to take place soon.[34][35][36] Two fundraising concerts, in support of the album, were announced a week after the graffiti started to appear, on March 28th, which took place on May 9th and May 10th, at London's Eventim Apollo. Muse supported War Child & Médecins Sans Frontières on night one, and The Big Issue on night two.[37] Prior to the two shows, a very small gig, kept in complete secrecy, was performed on April 7th, 2022, at Exeter's Cavern Club. The gig was recorded for \"Jim Beam's Welcome Sessions\".\nThe Will of the People Festivals Tour was the first largest tour of the album era. It took place between summer and winter of 2022. The band headlined festivals across Europe, with an additional few gigs on U.S. festivals. The show itself, at times, loosely resembled that of Simulation Theory World Tour's, having a large Murph-inspired inflatable figure on stage, overlooking the band and the crowd, and \"The Power Glove\" returning. During the festivals tour, a smaller tour, called the Will Of The People Theatre Tour, was announced in June of 2022. On it, Muse were performing in smaller venues across Europe and the USA.

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\nDéveloppement\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\nL'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\nThèmes\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\nSonorités\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques. Il s'agit de l'album le moins électronique des dernières décennies de la discographie du groupe. Un seul morceau, Verona, est principalement électronique. Le reste de l'album alterne des chansons rock, glam rock, nu metal ou encore acoustique au piano. En avril 2021, le batteur Dominic Howard déclare que l'album « sonne lourd »[19]. Won't Stand Down, le premier extrait de l'album a des sonorités rock et Heavy metal[20].\nListe des pistes\n[modifier | modifier le code]| No | Titre | Durée | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:29 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:37 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 4:59 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:57 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:26 | |||||||\n| 37:35 |\nFormats de l'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]La liste des titres est dévoilée le 17 mars 2022 lors de l'annonce officielle de l'album et de la sortie du single \"Compliance\" le même jour.

Elle a été réalisée par le réalisateur anglais Jeremi Durand.

Ses phénomènes font référence à de nombreux films d’horreur de la culture pop[26] des années 70 et 80[27] comme Poltergeist, Vendredi 13, L’Exorciste, Scream, Saw[28] et la saga Halloween (les masques portés par les personnages)[25], mais également Ça avec les ballons rouges et l’imperméable jaune porté par le clown, accrochés au mur, dans le couloir de l’hôtel Overlook dans le film Shining[27].\nTournée\n[modifier | modifier le code]La tournée promotionnelle de l'album, le \"Will of the People World Tour\" débute en avril 2022 à Londres et se termine par la tournée des stades en Europe de Mai à Juillet 2023 et une date en Malaisie à Kuala Lumpur fin Juillet 2023.\nLes premières dates concernant la tournée promotionnelle de l'album sont annoncées en 2021.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nRemove ads\nBackground and recording\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nRemove ads\nPromotion and release\nSummarize\nPerspective\nThe first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nRemove ads\nComposition\nMusically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\nSummarize\nPerspective\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nRemove ads\nCommercial performance\nIn the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nRemove ads\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\nPersonnel\nSummarize\nPerspective\n|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nRemove ads\nCharts\nSummarize\nPerspective\nRemove ads\nCertifications\nReferences\nWikiwand - on\nSeamless Wikipedia browsing.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\nAchtergrond\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\nWill of the People World Tour\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\nOntvangst\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \"Generally favorable reviews\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\nNummers\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\nBezetting\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\n- Dominic Howard – drums\nHitnoteringen\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\nExterne links\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

The song is intended to be a \"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \"[takes] it seriously.\"[8]\nMusic video\neditThe music video for \"Will of the People\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \"Will of the People\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\nThe music video for \"Will of the People\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\".[4]\nPersonnel\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\nCharts\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\nReferences\nedit- ^ \"WOTP August 26th.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nBackground and recording\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nPromotion and release\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nComposition\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\n|---|---|\n| Source | Rating |\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\n| Review scores | |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | [32] |\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\n| DIY | [34] |\n| Gigwise | [35] |\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\n| NME | [38] |\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nCommercial performance\n[edit]In the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nTrack listing\n[edit]All tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\n| No. | Title | Length |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | \"Will of the People\" | 3:18 |\n| 2. | \"Compliance\" | 4:10 |\n| 3. | \"Liberation\" | 3:06 |\n| 4. | \"Won't Stand Down\" | 3:29 |\n| 5. | \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" | 3:36 |\n| 6. | \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" | 3:00 |\n| 7. | \"Kill or Be Killed\" | 5:00 |\n| 8. | \"Verona\" | 4:56 |\n| 9. | \"Euphoria\" | 3:23 |\n| 10. | \"We Are Fucking Fucked\" | 3:36 |\n| Total length: | 37:40 |\nPersonnel\n[edit]|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nCharts\n[edit]\nWeekly charts[edit]\n|\nYear-end charts[edit]\n|\nCertifications\n[edit]| Region | Certification | Certified units/sales |\n|---|---|---|\n| France (SNEP)[86] | Platinum | 100,000‡ |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[87] | Gold | 100,000‡ |\n|\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Instagram\".\n- ^ a b Moore, Sam (16 May 2022). \"Matt Bellamy says Muse's 'Will Of The People' is \"a greatest hits album – of new songs\"\".

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\nTracce\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nFormazione\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\n- Gruppo\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Produzione\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\n- Andrea \"Waarp\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\nClassifiche\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\n|---|---|\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\nNote\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\nAccording to Muse, \"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[5]\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \"Best-Of Album\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \"RTL 2\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\nBackground\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\", adding \"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\".\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\nRecording\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \"totally resetting\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely. Producer Aleks Von Korff, who previously worked with Muse as an engineer on Simulation Theory, and produced Bellamy's solo material - songs like Tomorrow's World - also posted a picture from Red Room during that time, with the wooden Kawai piano.\nBetween April and June 2021, the band took a break from recording, to work on a remix of Origin of Symmetry. In early June, Matt and Dom joined Chris in the UK, continuing work on the album.[16] With the entire band back together in person, recording continued at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2021. The band were also joined by Muse's long-time engineer, Adrian Bushby, who posted a picture of him and Howard at Abbey Road Studios tracking drums.[17] This makes the upcoming album the second LP to be partially recorded at Abbey Road, after 20 years, when Origin of Symmetry was recorded at the facility. The album appears to have also been partially recorded at RAK Studios at the end of 2021, with Tre Cool from Green Day mentioned meeting up with Muse during their stay at the studio whilst recording their album, Saviors.[18]\nOn December 1st, 2021, Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer at Sterling Sound Studios posted a picture of Bellamy and Howard sitting on a couch, with the entire album at the mastering stage during that time. [19]\nRelease\nOn December 25th, 2021, Bellamy made up for the lack of a muse.mu Christmas present with a short livestream from his Tesla, on Muse's Instagram profile, showcasing part of Won't Stand Down. The 60 second stream was then screen-recorded by a few people, with copyright bots deleting the posts, hinting at the song being near its release. Matt's minute-long stream can be listened to here. The then-approaching release of the song was teased once again on Muse's New Years Eve Instagram post, when they wrote a caption saying \"Looking forward to WSD. We'll see you on the other side!\", before quickly replacing \"WSD\" with \"2022\". Won't Stand Down was subsequently announced a week later, on January 7th, 2022, on Muse's social media[21], with wontstanddown.muse.mu spotted being online a day earlier. Together with it also came the single artwork and a new promo image of the band. The song was released on January 13th, 2022, on digital platforms.\nAlmost two months later, on March 2nd, 2022, Bellamy posted an Instagram story in which he went over the guitar tuning for Won't Stand Down, while mentioning that a second heavy song will appear on the album.[22]\nOn March 9th, 2022, Muse posted a short, half-minute album teaser video on their YouTube, simply titled \"MUSE\", which depicts statues of the band's heads being torn down by a group of rioters in the middle of a desert, while wearing mirror masks from the Won't Stand Down music video, with a choir of Matts chanting the line \"The Will of the People\", name of the album and title track, with album artwork displayed at the very end of the video.[23]\nTwo days later, on March 11th, 2022, it was discovered by Muse fans that the index code from wontstanddown.muse.mu, contains basic album info, including the tracklist and anagrams for each song which will appear on the album. The same day, Muse announced a new song/single, Compliance. The song, and its music video, leaked on March 15th through Vimeo, before being deleted from the platform on the same day. A day later, anagrams from the wontstanddown index code were also resolved, leaking song titles and the tracklist. Compliance's music video was announced together with the album name on March 16th[24].\nThe album's release date has finally been announced, together with the release of Compliance, on March 17th, 2022. It is available for pre-ordering via willofthepeople.muse.mu and is set to be released on August 26th, 2022.\nMatt reportedly said, to one of the fans after one of the London Apollo charity gigs, in May of 2022, that they intend to release two more songs before the album drops. A day after the second gig, on May 11th, Apple Music began to show the track duration for the title song, while a few days later, on May 13th, a release date for the song was set up for it on Amazon.[25] This led fans to speculate, that Will of the People would be the next single from the album. The song was later leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of June 1st was announced a day later, on May 27th.\nAfter being played on every gig of the Will of the People Summer Festivals Tour in June & July of 2022, it was announced by Muse on July 13th, 2022, that Kill or Be Killed would be the next song to be released from the album. It was released on July 21st, 2022, at 3PM BST.[26] This is also the last single before the album drop.\nDue to the fact that some people were able to get hold of the album earlier, on August 22nd, short snippets (phone recordings) of the unreleased songs from the album were leaked on Twitter, exception being We Are Fucking Fucked.[27] A day later, on August 23rd, the fifth single was announced by Muse, being You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. The single, and it's music video, are due to be released on August 26th, together with the album.\nOn August 1st, 2022, it was announced, that Will of the People would also be releasing as an NFT, available on the platform called \"Serenade\".[28] Limited to 1000 copies, it is the first new music format to be charted in the UK since 2015, when music streaming data started counting in the charts, alongside CD, LP and download sales. The NFT cover art is slightly different to the standard one, featuring a purple/blue colour scheme, instead of the orange/blue one, and also featuring Muse's signatures on the digital cover itself.\nOn November 24th, 2022, it was announced by Muse that a new single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On), featuring Italian singer, Elisa Toffoli would be released the next day.\nOn December 9th, 2022, Ghosts (How Can I Move On) was announced to have a second single, featuring French singer, Mylène Farmer and was released simultaneously.\nCritical Reception\nAfter the release, Metacritic scored the album in 71 out of 100, indicating the generally positive and favourable reviews. It was also commercially successful to become the Muse's seventh UK No.1 album. NME described the ninth album as their \"best music in these years\" and more respectable than their previous awkward trend-chasing album \"Simulation Theory\"[29]. Won't Stand Down and Kill or Be Killed have been appointed as the greatest sounds of all Muse's track by some mainstream critics, praising the styles and bringing the best composition into this album, implying those two tracks is going to be the new Stockholm Syndrome\nCritic also spotted the last track, We Are Fucking Fucked, as a perfect closer to highlighting the straightforward lyrics that deliver the powerful chorus, which is giving a throwback to Showbiz and Black Holes and Revelations era.\nThe album was well-received amongst critics, with Kerrang rating it 4/5[30], and Riff Magazine rating it 9/10[31]. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock Magazine also rated the album 9/10,[32] while Record Collector rated Will of the People with four stars and Gigwise gave the album a score of 8/10.[33]\nArtwork & Design\nWith Jesse Lee Stout back as their creative director, all the design and creative elements from the live shows, the music videos, and the rest of the art, are again intertwined with each other, like during Simulaiton Theory. The first design element of the album was the monogram (shown in the picture), consisting of letters \"W\", \"O\", \"T\" and \"P\". It first appeared on the single artwork for Won't Stand Down.and was already speculated at that time, that the monogram might be linked to the album name. The monogram makes appearances throughout the entirety of the album era.\nThe artwork, made by Portuguese digital artist Tiago Marinho, is set somewhere in a post-apocalyptic city, located in the middle of some desert (the design is very similar to the post-apocalyptic London, shown on the Sing for Absolution single artwork), and shows large demolished statues of the band's heads, with a group of rioters, later revealed to be the \"masked hackers\", standing next to them. The character of this \"masked hacker\", also dubbed as \"Will\" (hailing from the album's name), wears a reflective mask, which, like the monogram, also appears throughout the entire album cycle.\nOn the cover, each of the three demolished heads has graffiti sprayed all over them. These include the WOTP monograms scattered on each of the heads, aswel as names of songs. Other words written as graffiti include \"Die\" and \"Fuck off\" on Matt's head, both lines from the songs. Dom's head also includes \"IX\" written on it in Roman numerals, standing for the album being their ninth one. This is the first artwork since Black Holes and Revelations to not feature the Muse logo, or the album name on the art itself. It is also the second album artwork in a row / second main album artwork alltogether, to feature the bands' faces.\nThe story behind the album artwork is represented in the music video for the single, Will of the People.\nTouring\nOn March 20th, 2022, several fans have spotted graffiti and stickers with the, then unknown monogram, in and around the Shepherd's Bush Empire area in the Shepherd's Bush district of London, UK. It was unknown what exactly this meant at the time. Some have suggested that it was just a marketing campaign, while others have suggested a surprise show was going to take place soon.[34][35][36] Two fundraising concerts, in support of the album, were announced a week after the graffiti started to appear, on March 28th, which took place on May 9th and May 10th, at London's Eventim Apollo. Muse supported War Child & Médecins Sans Frontières on night one, and The Big Issue on night two.[37] Prior to the two shows, a very small gig, kept in complete secrecy, was performed on April 7th, 2022, at Exeter's Cavern Club. The gig was recorded for \"Jim Beam's Welcome Sessions\".\nThe Will of the People Festivals Tour was the first largest tour of the album era. It took place between summer and winter of 2022. The band headlined festivals across Europe, with an additional few gigs on U.S. festivals. The show itself, at times, loosely resembled that of Simulation Theory World Tour's, having a large Murph-inspired inflatable figure on stage, overlooking the band and the crowd, and \"The Power Glove\" returning. During the festivals tour, a smaller tour, called the Will Of The People Theatre Tour, was announced in June of 2022. On it, Muse were performing in smaller venues across Europe and the USA. Some of them haven't seen Muse perform live in almost 20 years.

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\nDéveloppement\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\nL'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\nThèmes\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\nSonorités\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques. Il s'agit de l'album le moins électronique des dernières décennies de la discographie du groupe. Un seul morceau, Verona, est principalement électronique. Le reste de l'album alterne des chansons rock, glam rock, nu metal ou encore acoustique au piano. En avril 2021, le batteur Dominic Howard déclare que l'album « sonne lourd »[19]. Won't Stand Down, le premier extrait de l'album a des sonorités rock et Heavy metal[20].\nListe des pistes\n[modifier | modifier le code]| No | Titre | Durée | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:29 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:37 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 4:59 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:57 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:26 | |||||||\n| 37:35 |\nFormats de l'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]La liste des titres est dévoilée le 17 mars 2022 lors de l'annonce officielle de l'album et de la sortie du single \"Compliance\" le même jour.

Elle a été réalisée par le réalisateur anglais Jeremi Durand.

Ses phénomènes font référence à de nombreux films d’horreur de la culture pop[26] des années 70 et 80[27] comme Poltergeist, Vendredi 13, L’Exorciste, Scream, Saw[28] et la saga Halloween (les masques portés par les personnages)[25], mais également Ça avec les ballons rouges et l’imperméable jaune porté par le clown, accrochés au mur, dans le couloir de l’hôtel Overlook dans le film Shining[27].\nTournée\n[modifier | modifier le code]La tournée promotionnelle de l'album, le \"Will of the People World Tour\" débute en avril 2022 à Londres et se termine par la tournée des stades en Europe de Mai à Juillet 2023 et une date en Malaisie à Kuala Lumpur fin Juillet 2023.\nLes premières dates concernant la tournée promotionnelle de l'album sont annoncées en 2021.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nRemove ads\nBackground and recording\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nRemove ads\nPromotion and release\nSummarize\nPerspective\nThe first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nRemove ads\nComposition\nMusically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\nSummarize\nPerspective\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nRemove ads\nCommercial performance\nIn the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nRemove ads\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\nPersonnel\nSummarize\nPerspective\n|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nRemove ads\nCharts\nSummarize\nPerspective\nRemove ads\nCertifications\nReferences\nWikiwand - on\nSeamless Wikipedia browsing.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\nAchtergrond\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\nWill of the People World Tour\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\nOntvangst\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \"Generally favorable reviews\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\nNummers\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\nBezetting\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\n- Dominic Howard – drums\nHitnoteringen\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\nExterne links\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

The song is intended to be a \"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \"[takes] it seriously.\"[8]\nMusic video\neditThe music video for \"Will of the People\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \"Will of the People\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\nThe music video for \"Will of the People\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\".[4]\nPersonnel\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\nCharts\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\nReferences\nedit- ^ \"WOTP August 26th.

The song's name has been \"officially\" leaked on March 14th, 2022 via the JSON output from wontstanddown.muse.mu, which contains basic album info. In late May of 2022, Apple Music began showing the track length of the song in the album playlist, while Amazon set up a release date of June the 1st. The song itself got leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of the single, being June 1st, was announced a day later.\nWill Of The People has previously been teased by Muse through a couple of short clips, on YouTube and Instagram, revealing the album's name. Upon the album announcement, Warner described it as a track that \"brings playful provocation to a dystopian glam-rocker\"[2]\nAccording to Matt, the song is \"like a populist parody, almost the antithesis to Uprising\", adding \"Whereas ‘Uprising’ was almost populist but taking it seriously, ‘Will Of The People’ is almost, ‘Do we know that we’re stupid now? Do we know how silly this sounds and looks?’ Inside of me, there’s always been this little bit of a conflict between the desire for direct democracy and a bit more actual power to the people, but then at the same time realising that sometimes the people can be mad… Because they’ve had no voice for so long, populism ends up becoming distorted and strange and spiting everything. People end up spiting things just because they don’t have any fucking say.\".[3]\nInstrumentation\nThe track starts out with a looping crowd, chanting the line \"The Will of the People\". The same loop appears throughout the song. The track itself is based around guitar, bass and drums, with some guitar-synth layering, which is especially noticeable during the last part. The song also features heavy use of roto-toms during the bridge part. It also features a lot of \"ooh\"s and \"woah\"s throughout the song, aswel as a high-pitched scream, at around 2 minutes and 42 seconds. The choir consists of around 150 audio tracks, all of which were put together in remote, due to all the lockdowns throughout the pandemic.[4]\nStylistically, the song is reminiscent of songs such as Uprising, Psycho and Supermassive Black Hole, featuring a similar swing-rhythm and elements of glam-rock and a punchy 50s Elvis rockabilly. The looping choir has been compared to \"The Beautiful People\" by Marilyn Manson and the songs structure has been compared to that of Green Day, sounding like 'East Jesus Nowhere'. It's also been compared to Pressure and New Kind of Kick, having the same \"rock'n'roll\" feel with the saturated vocals. The song runs in A-Major and at a tempo of 130BPM.\nThe rough layout of the riff, which appears in the pre-chorus of the song, extends all the way back to 2019, when it was played by Matt as an improv riff after Unsustainable, during the Simulation Theory Tour.\nWill of the People is one of three songs on the album to feature Jeff Buckley's Telecaster. It is used for the high bluesy leads during the choruses.\nMusic Video\nLike the song itself, the music video was also used in the teaser, following the album reveal in March of 2022. The video itself tells the story of how the heads got torn down during a riot, which can be seen on the album artwork.\nMore here.\nTrivia\nFollowing the release of the music video, Muse posted the official lyrics under the YouTube video, but similar to other lyrical mistakes in the past (such as the various misprints in the Origin of Symmetry sleeve notes), the official lyrics contain two errors. As confirmed by Aleks Von Korff on Reddit, a line from the first verse is written as “Don't need a goon to flood with devotion”, when Matt sings ”Don't need a gun to flirt with devotion”[5], while a line from the second verse, written as “We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces” is in fact “your nation”.\nThe chants/crowd vocals are not only sung by Matt Bellamy. Instead, they are sung by the entire band, together with Elle, Bing Bellamy, Chris's wife Caris and his kids, Ernie, Buster, Teddi, Tabitha and Indiana.\nLive\nPerformed live as an intro to the shows, it features a slightly extended guitar chugging intro. It was first performed live on June 4th, 2022.\nMore here.\nLyrics\nOfficial lyrics as posted by Muse, however these lyrics do contain errors as noted above.\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nLet’s push the emperors into the ocean, Don’t need a goon to flood with devotion, With every hour our number increases We’ll smash your institutions to pieces\nWe need a transformation One we all can see We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nFree your sons and unlock your daughters We’ll throw the baby out with the bath water With every second our anger increases We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces\nWe need a transmutation One we all conceive We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the sheeple, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nWelcome to the desecration, baby We'll build up you right up and we'll tear you down Welcome to the celebration, baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nReferences\n- ↑ https://wontstanddown.muse.mu/api/v1/catalogue/new/\n- ↑ https://themusicuniverse.com/muse-announces-will-people/\n- ↑ https://www.nme.com/big-reads/muse-cover-interview-2022-will-of-the-people-3243209\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CeRBJolg96L/\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/v3wydc/are_these_the_real_lyrics_or_did_apple_music/ib2fui1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3",

Four gigs were announced in total, all in the UK and all outdoor stadium gigs. As expected, more tour dates were announced throughout the following months, leading up to the tour itself. Bellamy mentioned, in an interview with Zane Lowe in August of 2022, that the tour would take place between January and July of 2023, starting in Mexico, continuing in the U.S. and Canada, and finishing in Europe.[1]\nMexico\nMexican dates were announced on October 7th, 2022. The tour included stops at Monterrey's Estadio Banorte, Guadalajara's Arena VFG and Mexico City's Foro Sol, spreading over two dates, on both 22nd and 23rd of January. The additional date in Mexico City, on 23rd, was announced on October 27th, 2022.\nThe short Mexican leg took place before the U.S. legs.\nUnited States & Canada\nTaking place after the short Mexican leg, U.S. and Canada legs exclusively featured indoor shows, with the only exception being the gig at Shaky Knees festival in Atlanta. Most tour dates were announced on September 29th, 2022. Two additional gigs in Montreal and Quebec were announced on October 6th, while additional gigs in St. Louis and Oakland were announced on October 17th.\nThe tour featured two legs and one \"lone\" show. The first leg began at Chicago's United Center on February 25th, and ended at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center on March 19th. The second leg started with the show at Phoenix's Desert Diamond Arena on April 2nd, ending with a gig at Salt Lake City's Vivint Smart Home Arena. The final show in the U.S. took place on May 6th, at the afforementioned Shaky Knees festival.\nEurope\nStadium gigs\nAs mentioned above, the first gigs of the tour that were announced were the UK gigs. These took place in Plymouth's Home Park on May 27th, Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium on June 20th, Glasgow's Bellahouston Park on June 23rd and Milton Keynes's National Bowl on June 25th. The rest of the tour was announced afterwards. Additional European dates have been announced on January 20th, 2023, including the first show of the tour in Spain, in Santander's El Sardinero on July 4th, and a gig at Nancy's Zénith amphitheatre on July 6th, where they be played a headlining show, as part of the Nancy Open Air festival.\nThe rest of the European dates were announced soon afterwards. The European features Muse's first shows in the cities of Wiener Neustadt, Austria and Santander, Spain. Additionally, the show at Milton Keynes's National Bowl was Muse's first live show at the site. The last time Muse were at Milton Keynes before, was during the rehearsals for The Resistance stadium tour, in 2010. Additionally, Muse played in the city of The Hague, Netherlands after almost 23 years, and Lyon, France after about a decade.\nThe European tour featured an indoor production, scaled for an outdoor gig, and included both stadium and festival shows.\nArena gigs\nOn June 26th, the band announced indoor arena gigs for the UK and Ireland in autumn, with Nova Twins supporting.[2] The gigs announced are set to take place in Dublin's 3Arena on September 27th, Manchester's AO Arena on September 29th and London's The O2 on October 1st and 2nd.\nTravel packages\nThree travel packages were available to buy for three dates off of the European leg of the tour; Cologne (June 9th), Paris (July 8th) and Milan (July 22nd). Each travel package included, together with two tickets, a two-night stay at a hotel (king or twin bed rooms options are available). Hotels which were included are Cologne's Pullman, Paris's Marriott Ambassador and Milan's Marriott. An optional third night add-on was also included in each package, for additional cost. Additionally, two exclusive posters, commemorating Muse's performance at each venue in the city (RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Stade de France in Paris and San Siro in Milan) were included in each travel package, as were on-site hosts, and, for the Cologne gig, a roundtrip fare on the metro to the stadium.\nMore on the travel packages can be seen here.\nAsia\nAfter being teased on February 16th by the band on social media, the band announced the only Asian gig of the tour in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, on February 22nd. The open-air gig took place at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium on 29th July 2023.[3][4] The show marked the first Muse gig that took place in the country since 2007.\nSaudi Arabia\nIn 2024, Muse took time off touring to focus on families and solo projects. Despite that, two gigs took place in Saudi Arabia in December; The first one in Abu Dhabi, at F1, and another one, in Riyadh, at the Banban Festival.\nSupporting acts\nThje first support act to be announced were Royal Blood, who opened for Muse during the European open-air leg (exceptions being the Nancy and Glasgow gigs, aswell as festivals). For the U.S. shows, Evanescence were announced as the main opening act. Additional support acts for U.S. shows were announced on November 9th, 2022; One Ok Rock supported Muse during the first half of the U.S. leg (between Chicago and Philadelphia gigs), while Highly Suspect will be supporting Muse during the second half of the U.S. leg (between the Phoenix and Salt Lake City gigs).[5] On January 13th, 2023, The Warning were announced as the support act for the Mexico gigs.[6]\nOn March 22nd, both The Warning and One Ok Rock were announced as additional support acts for select European dates. The Warning supported Muse on the U.K. leg (plus one stop in Lyon, France), while One Ok Rock supported them on the rest of the European leg (excluding festivals, and the Glasgow gig). Joining the two is Twin Atlantic, who opened together with The Warning on the afforementioned Bellahouston Park gig in Glasgow.[7] A support change was made for the gig in Bern, Switzerland, as One Ok Rock couldn't perform at due to unforeseen circumstances; Replacing them was Emilie Zoé. Kyoto Protocol were announced as the support act for the Kuala Lumpur gig only a few weeks before the show itself, on July 11th, 2023.\nOn June 26th, alongside the annoucement of the UK and Ireland indoor gigs, Nova Twins were announced to be supporting Muse on these gigs.[8]\nProduction\nAs with the previous large headlining tour, the Simulation Theory World Tour, this tour features indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The stage set-up in general is a hybrid between the 2022 festivals tour and the autumn theatre tour setups. It includes an inflatable rotating figure of Will the Hacker as a backdrop, together with a grid of light fixtures, similar to the one from the theatre tour. Joining Will the Hacker is a new figure nicknamed \"Baph\".\nThe festival setup (which was also used during the Mexican leg of the tour) bears more resemblance to the 2022 summer festivals setup, with the only major difference being an addition of the lighting grid, replacing the LED strip lights behind the band. An inflatable figure of Will is present throughout the entire show, including the encore, while the setlists themselves (exceptions being the Mexican shows) include no rotations, and are more akin to the 2022 summer festivals setlists\nThe indoor setup, which premiered at the North American leg, features a stage with transparent floor, allowing for it to be illuminated from below, with an addition of a larger B-stage, six moving glass panels with lights, hung above the band, more lights on the back-grid, and, as mentioned above, an inflatable figure named \"Baph\", joining \"Will\", getting inflated for the encore. Because of the differences, the setlists for the North American shows also got \"revamped\".\nThe stage for the European outdoor setup had the same core of elements as the indoor arena setup , with an addition of two stage wings on either side, aswell as larger LED screens on both sides of the stage, equipped with light fixtures. It also featured a longer runway to the B-stage, with the B-stage itself being slightly bigger than it was for the indoor shows. \"Will\" is now equipped with a LED screen inside of his mask, an exclusive to the stadium/headlining shows, as festivals still use the older and smaller version of the figure. The full outdoor set up was officially revealed on Muse's Instagram[9], a day prior to the first gig in Plymouth, on May 26th, after pictures and videos of the stage being set up surfaced on social media a few days before.[10]\nFor the Saudi Arabia gigs in 2024, the core of the production remained the same, however, the burning WOTP logo was ditched.\nShort tour documentaries\nA series of short documentaries was set to be released throughout the tour itself, shot and edited by Muse's WOTP tour photographer Johann Ramos (known as \"The Work of Jar\") and Centreline Films, posted on Muse's YouTube channel.\nSix documentaries have been released so far. The first one is a recap of the first leg of the tour in Mexico, the second one goes over the rehearsals, which took place in California's Ontario, aswell as the Chicago show. The third one looks back at week one of the U.S. leg of the tour, the fourth one talks about the homecoming Plymouth show, and week one of the European leg, can be seen here. The fifht one shows various clips and highlights from the European stadium tour. The sixth features Matt talking about Kill or Be Killed, while showing pre-show backstage footage.\nAverage Setlist\nDuring the January leg in Mexico, the setlist remained relatively unchaged from the shows off of the 2022 festivals tour. This changed with leg 1 in the U.S., starting in Chicago, in February, when the show was updated, in turn bringing in a new setlist format. This first indoor leg in the U.S. brought in live premieres of Verona and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental). STT Interstitials 1 and 3 returned as Simulation Theory Theme, which was played from tape, mashed up with [JFK], acting as an intro to Kill or Be Killed. Additionally, Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation version was played from tape, as an interstitial, before Compliance. Also returning after several years were Resistance, Undisclosed Desires and the shortened version of Isolated System. Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses) was also played, making this the second big headlining tour to feature Assassin, played in full since the Black Holes And Revelations Tour, with it previously being only played during The Drones World Tour 2015/16.\nWith the announcement of the Absolution XX Anniversary boxset in September of 2023, the band looks to have put an emphasis on songs off of the album during the indoor autumn leg in the UK and Ireland, with both Butterflies & Hurricanes and Apocalypse Please played on the first night of the leg in Dublin. Both songs were played for the first time in 6 years and 7 years respectively. During the leg, Stockholm Syndrome replaced Kill or Be Killed in its slot in Manchester. Space Dementia also made a return.\nThe setlist changed the most with the 2024 Saudi Arabia gigs, with the usual opener (Will ofthe People) replaced with the Simulation Theory Theme / JFK mashup (played from tape) and Won't Stand Down. Starlight was also chosen to replace Knights of Cydonia as a closer for the first time in 11 years. Bellamy's own piece Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four audiobook soundtrack) was also played live for the first time before Time Is Running Out.\nMexican shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Pressure / Map of the Problematique / Bliss\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased / New Born\n- The Gallery\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Time Is Running Out\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nU.S./Canada/Ireland/UK indoor shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Citizen Erased / New Born / Stockholm Syndrome / Pressure / Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses version) / Butterflies & Hurricanes (UK + Ireland only)\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona / Liberation (Canada only) / Apocalypse Please (UK + Ireland only) / Space Dementia (UK only)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Resistance / Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed / Stockholm Syndrome (Manchester only)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/stadium shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome\n- Resistance\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/US festival shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Thought Contagion\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nSaudi Arabia shows set\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Resistance\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Madness\n- Thought Contagion\n- Pressure (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Hanging in Victory Square (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEncore\n- Isolated System (shortened) (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Undisclosed Desires (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nNotes & Exceptions\n- During the four Mexican shows, rotation slots got swapped around the setlists. Generally, the setlists for these shows were more or less the same to these of the Will of the People Festivals Tour.\n- With the start of the U.S. tour, the production was updated, in turn also changing the setlists - Scrambling songs on the setlist and changing its template, replacing The Gallery with Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Remix) and adding songs like Verona, The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental) and Isolated System to the sets.\n- A few gigs into the U.S. leg, Undisclosed Desires was put into rotation with Resistance.\n- Liberation was in rotation with Verona on double nights during the NA leg of the tour, which were only the second night of both Quebec City and Montreal. Verona was dropped for the UK indoor leg with Apocalypse Please and Space Dementia played in rotation in its place.\n- The Shaky Knees Festival gig featured a shorter setlist with a few changes compared to the indoor gig setlists; Thought Contagion was played earlier in the set, Isolated System was played before Supermassive Black Hole and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality)'s instrumental version and JFK / Simulation Theory Theme intro were ditched from the set. The same setlist was played at the NorthSide festival in Denmark.\n- For the stadium shows, Resistance and Undisclosed Desires were brought out of rotation and were both played at each show.\n- The stadium shows also featured less songs in the first rotation slot, these being Bliss and Map of the Problematique (with the latter only being played three times so far). Stockholm Syndrome joined the two at the Rome gig.\n- Showbiz was played instead of Knights of Cydonia at the Werchter Festival gig after technical issues meant the latter song couldn't be played. This made it the first gig in which all 9 studio albums were represented.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2024-12-13 | Banban (Soundstorm Festival) | Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |\n| 2024-12-08 | Du Arena (Formula 1 Grand Prix) | Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates |\n| 2023-11-04 | Foro Pegaso (Hell & Heaven Festival) | Toluca de Lerdo, Mexico |\n| 2023-10-02 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-10-01 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-09-29 | AO Arena | Manchester, UK |\n| 2023-09-27 | 3Arena | Dublin, Ireland |\n| 2023-07-29 | Bukit Kiara Equestrian Resort | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |\n| 2023-07-22 | Stadio Giuseppe Meazza | Milan, Italy |\n| 2023-07-18 | Stadio Olimpico | Rome, Italy |\n| 2023-07-15 | Stade Orange Vélodrome | Marseille, France |\n| 2023-07-12 | BernExpo Areal | Bern, Switzerland |\n| 2023-07-08 | Stade de France | Paris, France |\n| 2023-07-06 | Zénith de Nancy (Nancy Open Air) | Nancy, France |\n| 2023-07-04 | Campos de Sport de El Sardinero | Santander, Spain |\n| 2023-07-01 | Festivalpark Werchter (Rock Werchter) | Werchter, Belgium |\n| 2023-06-29 | Matmut Atlantique | Bordeaux, France |\n| 2023-06-25 | The National Bowl | Milton Keynes, UK |\n| 2023-06-23 | Bellahouston Park | Glasgow, UK |\n| 2023-06-20 | John Smith's Stadium | Huddersfield, UK |\n| 2023-06-18 | Flugplatz Neuhausen (Southside Festival) | Neuhausen ob Eck, Germany |\n| 2023-06-17 | Eichenring (Hurricane Festival) | Scheessel, Germany |\n| 2023-06-15 | Groupama Stadium | Lyon, France |\n| 2023-06-11 | Park 360 (Rock for People) | Hradec Králové, Czech Republic |\n| 2023-06-09 | RheinEnergieStadion | Cologne, Germany |\n| 2023-06-07 | Malieveld | The Hague, Netherlands |\n| 2023-06-03 | Stadion Wiener Neustadt | Wiener Neustadt, Austria |\n| 2023-06-01 | Eskelunden (NorthSide) | Århus, Denmark |\n| 2023-05-27 | Home Park | Plymouth, UK |\n| 2023-05-06 | Central Park (Shaky Knees Music Festival) | Atlanta, GA, USA |\n| 2023-04-20 | Vivint Arena | Salt Lake City, UT, USA |\n| 2023-04-18 | Climate Pledge Arena | Seattle, WA, USA |\n| 2023-04-16 | Moda Center | Portland, OR, USA |\n| 2023-04-14 | Oakland Arena | Oakland, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-12 | Honda Center | Anaheim, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-10 | Pechanga Arena | San Diego, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-08 | T-Mobile Arena | Las Vegas, NV, USA |\n| 2023-04-06 | Crypto.com Arena | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-04 | Ball Arena | Denver, CO, USA |\n| 2023-04-02 | Desert Diamond Arena | Phoenix, AZ, USA |\n| 2023-03-19 | Wells Fargo Center | Philadelphia, PA, USA |\n| 2023-03-17 | Madison Square Garden | New York City, NY, USA |\n| 2023-03-15 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-14 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-12 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-11 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-09 | Scotiabank Arena | Toronto, ON, Canada |\n| 2023-03-07 | Nationwide Arena | Columbus, OH, USA |\n| 2023-03-05 | Chaifetz Arena | St. Louis, MO, USA |\n| 2023-03-03 | Dickies Arena | Fort Worth, TX, USA |\n| 2023-03-02 | Toyota Center | Houston, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-28 | Moody Center | Austin, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-26 | Target Center | Minneapolis, MN, USA |\n| 2023-02-25 | United Center | Chicago, IL, USA |\n| 2023-01-23 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-22 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-20 | Arena V.F.G. | Guadalajara, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-18 | Estadio Banorte | Monterrey, Mexico |\nSee also\nReferences\n- ↑ https://youtu.be/AMvtyphl9rA?t=2297\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CpMk5jDBxEG/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1628321276896112641\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CnXcXiNNSFy/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1638587091020914713/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/Csuf6rlqKCS/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZn26TSifb/",

It was released on 21 July 2022 as the fourth single ahead of their ninth studio album Will of the People, having already debuted in live format during festival shows of their Will of the People World Tour. It was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.\nRelease history\n[edit]\"Kill or Be Killed\" was debuted in live format at the 4 June 2022 show of the Will of the People World Tour, at the Rock am Ring music festival in Germany, during which the previous single \"Will of the People\" also received its live debut. \"Kill or Be Killed\" was played as the first song of the encore, before the closing song \"Knights of Cydonia\", and without any official prior announcement from the band.[1]\n\"Kill or Be Killed\" was subsequently played at every following show of the tour, emerging as a fan favourite. On 14 July, Muse confirmed through social media that \"Kill or Be Killed\" would be released as the fourth single ahead of Will of the People one week later on 21 July 2022, with a thirty-second snippet of the studio version of the song becoming available to preview through TikTok later that day.[2]\nWriting and composition\n[edit]Prior to the live debut of \"Kill or Be Killed\", in an interview with Apple Music 1 on 17 March 2022, Matt Bellamy described \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"the best metal/prog track we've ever done\", featuring \"industrial-tinged, granite-heavy guitar riffs\".[3] Music journalists described \"Kill or Be Killed\" as progressive metal,[4][5] heavy metal,[6] alternative metal,[7] and metalcore.[8]\nFor the guitar solo, Bellamy combined a tapping technique with a DigiTech Whammy, a pitch-shifting pedal, to shift rapidly between octaves. He said, \"I'm plainly cheating in that solo ... It sounds like I’m doing insane arpeggios. I'm not a shredder at all. I've never been a very good shredder, but I found ways to cut corners.\"[9]\nCharts\n[edit]| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[10] | 81 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[11] | 80 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[12] | 20 |\n| US Rock Airplay (Billboard)[13] | 37 |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Shutler, Ali (5 June 2022). \"Watch Muse perform new song 'Kill Or Be Killed' as they kick off summer tour\".

At the end, it is revealed that three of the rioters are infact the \"dicators\" (the band), which appear to be rioting against themselves. In the words of Matt Bellamy, \"\"Will of the People\" is fictional story set in a fictional metaverse on a fictional planet ruled by a fictional authoritarian state run by a fictional algorithm manifested by a fictional data centre running a fictional bank printing a fictional currency controlling a fictional population occupying a fictional city containing a fictional apartment where a fictional man woke up one day and thought \"fuck this.\"\"[1]\nThe song's music video itself, being that of the title track, contains alot of elements which are seen in the album artwork. It was also previously used as a short teaser for the album announcement, in March of 2022.[2]\nAdditional information\nThe video was directed by Tom Teller and produced by Frame 48. The same production company also handled post-production and VFX for both the Simulation Theory Film and all of Simulation Theory's music videos, with Tom Teller as executive director on all projects. The visual performance was motion captured by parkour athlete, Didi Alaoui at one of the Tempest Freerunning Academies in the USA.\nThis is the first music video during the Will of the People era which isn't filmed in the 4:3 format.\nWill of the People Screenshots\nCredits\n- Studio: Frame48\n- Freerunning Facility: Tempest Freerunning Academy\n- Director: Tom Teller\n- Creative Director: Jesse Lee Stout\n- Executive Producers: Julian Conner, Seth Josephson, Tom Teller\n- Performance Capture Athlete: Didi Alaoui\n- FX Artist: Alvaro Moreira\n- CG Supervisor & Lead Artist: Enrique De la Garza\n- CG Artists: Steven Lee, Stephanie Buschhorn, Isaac Zuren\n- Rigger: Jarom Brand\n- Animators: Paolo Cogliati, Matheus Caetano\n- Assistant Editor: Michele Nagy\n- Compositors: Sai Prudhvi, Mahesh Kanneboina, Maryam Riahi, Sreedhar Krkumar\n- Colorist: Bryan Smaller\n- Sound Designer: Gerry Vazquez\n- Character Artists: Mariano Ruiz Manzano, Isaac Olander\n- Asset Artist: Juan Fer Bravo\n- Storyboard Artist: David Green",

The Will of the People Festivals Tour took place between June 2022 and January 2023. This was the first tour of the Will of the People era, and first tour in three years, since the pandemic of 2020.\nInformation\nThe tour began one month after the WOTP promo gigs, and first gigs since 2019 alltogether, in Exeter's Cavern Club and London's Apollo gigs, on June 4th, 2022, with a performance at Rock am Ring in Germany. As mentioned above, this was the first major tour, supporting the album, Will of the People. The tour included Muse's debut performances at Nova Rock, Aftershock and Audacy Beach festivals, aswell as performances at the Isle of Wight, Eurockéennes and Rock in Rio Lisbon festivals, amongst others. The tour also included a special, more intimate invite-only gig, at the James B. Beam Distillery in Kentucky, when Muse played a gig as part of Jim Beam Welcome Sessions.\nWill of the People and Kill or Be Killed made their live debuts on the first leg of the tour, with Compliance and Won't Stand Down being played on the couple gigs before the tour. You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween made its debut on the second leg of the tour, in September. Nishe was brought back after 11 years, played before Madness, and also played in full for the first time since 2000. A Bellamy solo song, Behold, The Glove, returned, after last being present during the Simulation Theory World Tour in 2019, when it was played from tape as a short intro piece (then known as STT Interstitial 2). On this tour, the song was played in full, with the entire band.\nThe day before the first gig, on June 3rd, 2022, the entire tour's setlist template was leaked on Twitter.\nProduction\nThe show was, in some aspects, similar to the afforementioned previous tour. Similar to Murph the Robot, the tour featured its counterpart, a large inflatable \"masked hacker\" figure, nicknamed \"Will the Hacker\", which was set up on-stage behind the band, and was present throughout most of the show (excluding the fist few songs). It was revealed during Won't Stand Down. The main difference between Will the Hacker and Murph is that the hacker was a lot bigger and bulkier. It's made up of three separate parts: Two shoulders, sitting on each side of the head, which was attached to trussing, rotating left to right slightly. Behind the hacker were two thin walls of LED light strips, also attached to top trussing. Lights were used to illuminate the inflatable figure from different angles throughout the show.\nAlso similar to the Simulation Theory Tour was the use of The Power Glove. The difference, however, is, that, the new glove acted as an instrument, with a built-in smartphone, connected to the PA system, using a synthesizer app called \"NOISE\". Matt played Behold, The Glove and the synth intro of Uprising on the glove. While doing so, Bellamy wore an illuminating LED leather jacket, similar to the jacket worn during the previous tour.\nKeeping with the heavier style of the new songs, the gigs relied on heavy use of pyro, specifically, fire. The show opened with a large burning \"WOTP\" monogram logo, placed behind the band, while they play the song Will of the People. The fire can be re-ignited quickly at any given time, with the ability to lit up each letter separately. Fire machines are used throughout the rest of the show, during Won't Stand Down, Madness, Thought Contagion, Uprising, Kill or Be Killed and (later on during the tour) Knights of Cydonia.\nThree video interstitials, named \"Chant\", \"Parkour\" and \"Driving\" were played during the show. These included elements from Will of the People's music video. The \"Chant\" one was played before Will of the People, and showed the video of the stone heads being torn down, seen during the last part of the music video, and also in the album trailer, posted on Muse's YouTube channel. The \"Parkour\" one showed the rioter running and jumping over buildings, as seen during the music video's first part, and is played before Time Is Running Out. The \"Driving\" interstitial showed the vehicles from the music video being driven through the desert, and was played before Plug In Baby.\nWith Mercy being dropped from the setlists, Compliance took over as the song during which streamers are released.\nOn some dates, due to the logistics, some elements of the production weren't present on all gigs, or were swapped. This notably happened for the Lisbon gig at Rock in Rio, when the main production was headed to London, so the band were forced to use a minimal stage setup, which included replacing the figure of Will the Hacker with Murph the Robot, ditching the \"WOTP\" logo at the start, and changing the band's wardrobe. The same (or similar) minimal stage set-up was also present during the Telekom Street Gigs show in Cologne, Audacy Beach Festival in Fort Lauderdale and the iHeartRadio ALTer EGO in Los Angeles, while the burning logo itself didn't appear in Florence, at Firenze Rocks.\nAverage Setlist\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Pressure\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased\n- The Gallery\n- Compliance (w/ guitar)\n- Thought Contagion\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Nishe (shortened)\n- Madness\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nNotes\n- Map of the Problematique and Stockholm Syndrome share their outro riffs, being Duality, Calm Like a Bomb and the Unknown one, although they shuffle through them gig by gig.\n- Nishe was initially only played as a short 1-minuite snippet, but it was later extended to almost 2 minutes after the third show.\nExceptions\n- Citizen Erased was played at the Rock am Ring gig as an extra song after Madness while Map of the Problematique was played in the rotation slot.\n- For the first 4 shows of the tour, Thought Contagion was played between Supermassive Black Hole and Plug in Baby.\n- At the Isle of Wight Festival, Won't Stand Down was played after the rotation slot while Citizen Erased was played in said slot.\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween got its debut at Xacobeo Festival. It was played after Thought Contagion and replaced the MOTP/Stockholm Syndrome/Citizen Erased slot and was played there through September.\n- Tributing Queen Elizabeth II after her passing, \"God Save the Queen\" was played briefly at Xacobeo Festival, before Interlude.\n- Telekom Street Gigs, James B. Beam Distillery had notably shorter setlists, with Thought Contagion, Time Is Running Out, Nishe and Madness all being dropped with no replacement and some of the remaining songs were shuffled around. The only setlist difference between the two (other than the order of the songs) is that Behold, The Glove was played at the former while Minimum was played at the latter. The 2023 iHeartRadio gig at Los Angeles+s The Kia Forum had the shortest setlist of all shows, with just nine songs, being Will of the People, Hysteria, Won't Stand Down, Madness, Compliance, Supermassive Black Hole, Behold The Glove, Uprising and Starlight, which was the closer.\n- Aftershock Festival had a notably heavier setlist, with Stockholm Syndrome replacing Pressure, We Are Fucking Fucked replacing the summer rotation slot, New Born replacing Compliance, You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween replacing Thought Contagion, Minimum replacing Nishe and Madness being dropped with no replacement.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2023-01-14 | The Kia Forum (iHeartRadio ALTer EGO) | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2022-12-03 | Fort Lauderdale Beach (Audacy Beach Festival) | Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA |\n| 2022-10-09 | Discovery Park (Aftershock Festival) | Sacramento, CA, USA |\n| 2022-10-08 | James B.

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\nInformation\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\nThe Show\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \"WOTP\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \"Women will be what she was born to be\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\nMedia\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\nSetlist\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)",

To access the pre-sale code, members account must've been createad prior to September 19th, 2022.\nMuse were supported by Evanescence and One Ok Rock.\nThe Show\nThe Setlist\n- The setlist overall remained somewhat similar to both the Mexican leg and the festival tour the previous year - but with numerous changes and additions.\n- Verona and Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley remix both made their live debuts. The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\nProduction and Staging\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\n- The stage featured the burning \"WOTP\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\n- The \"Will the Hacker\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \"Baph\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona. Rain confetti was also released during Isolated System.\nTimetable\n- 16:30 - Concert club doors [9]\n- 17:30 - General admission\n- 18:30 - One Ok Rock\n- 19:30 - Evanescence\n- 21:00 - Muse\nMedia\nThe official aftermovie can be seen here.\nSetlist\n- Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Interlude + Hysteria + Cherub Rock\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Bliss (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed intro + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) [watch]\n- Compliance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Thought Contagion [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Verona [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Isolated System (shortened) [watch]\n- Resistance [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Madness [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - We Are Fucking Fucked [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black 3.0 #2, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental) [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype) - Supermassive Black Hole w/ Just Like This riff [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended) + Sweet Child O' Mine\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Mirror 2.0, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Behold, The Glove\n(aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Uprising (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Red Alert, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Prelude + Starlight\n(graphite finish red-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/ JFK + Kill or Be Killed [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\nGallery\nMatt on Will's shoulder during The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Version\nReferences\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center\n- ↑ https://www.ticketmaster.com/muse-will-of-the-people-tour-chicago-illinois-02-25-2023/event/04005D3315B43BD4\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://www.unitedcenter.com/events/2023/02/25/muse-will-of-the-people-tour/",

This webpage presents specific details about one concert as well as elements pertinent to the setlist.\n\nHowever, while it provides useful and specific insights regarding one event in 2023, the content is very narrowly focused. It does not address the wider scope of MUSE's activities during 2023-2024 nor does it provide information about festival appearances, upcoming concerts, or future performance announcements. Consequently, while it partially satisfies the overall goal of collecting concert information, it is limited in its comprehensiveness.\n\nThus, the webpage primarily fulfills part of the need to understand MUSE's recent live activities but lacks broader context and information about future plans or other performances.\n</think>\n<answer>\npartially satisfy\n</answer>",

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\nInformation\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\nThe Show\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \"WOTP\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \"Women will be what she was born to be\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\nMedia\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\nSetlist\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)",

To access the pre-sale code, members account must've been createad prior to September 19th, 2022.\nMuse were supported by Evanescence and One Ok Rock.\nThe Show\nThe Setlist\n- The setlist overall remained somewhat similar to both the Mexican leg and the festival tour the previous year - but with numerous changes and additions.\n- Verona and Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley remix both made their live debuts. The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\nProduction and Staging\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\n- The stage featured the burning \"WOTP\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\n- The \"Will the Hacker\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \"Baph\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona. Rain confetti was also released during Isolated System.\nTimetable\n- 16:30 - Concert club doors [9]\n- 17:30 - General admission\n- 18:30 - One Ok Rock\n- 19:30 - Evanescence\n- 21:00 - Muse\nMedia\nThe official aftermovie can be seen here.\nSetlist\n- Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Interlude + Hysteria + Cherub Rock\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Bliss (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed intro + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) [watch]\n- Compliance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Thought Contagion [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Verona [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Isolated System (shortened) [watch]\n- Resistance [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Madness [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - We Are Fucking Fucked [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black 3.0 #2, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental) [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype) - Supermassive Black Hole w/ Just Like This riff [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended) + Sweet Child O' Mine\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Mirror 2.0, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Behold, The Glove\n(aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Uprising (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Red Alert, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Prelude + Starlight\n(graphite finish red-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/ JFK + Kill or Be Killed [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\nGallery\nMatt on Will's shoulder during The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Version\nReferences\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center\n- ↑ https://www.ticketmaster.com/muse-will-of-the-people-tour-chicago-illinois-02-25-2023/event/04005D3315B43BD4\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://www.unitedcenter.com/events/2023/02/25/muse-will-of-the-people-tour/",

Matthew’s superb vocals along with Chris’ bass playing (my favourite) and Dominic’s drumming including gorgeous cinematics in between songs plus the structures built for the stage, pyrotechnics and confetti made the show really engaging and made everyone’s night much better. A spectacular show for a band that has been together for about 25 years and still bringing their signature electronic rock sounds as the heart of every show today, I can’t wait to catch them at Toronto again when they come back!",

Check it out below.\n- READ MORE: Halsey – ‘The Great Impersonator’ review: a brutal but brilliant reckoning with chronic illness\nThe single marked Halsey’s first material since their fifth and latest studio album ‘The Great Impersonator’, which was released last October. They debuted the track live this past weekend (March 7) during their slot at the Sips & Sounds festival in Austin, TX.\nDuring the performance, Halsey is seen sporting a while babydoll style dress with a black curly mullet hairstyle and black cowboy boots. They are seen jumping and running around the massive stage and its catwalk.\nThe track has nods to artists like Bikini Kill, with Halsey yelling: “Yes, sir, no, sir, on all fours/Are you ready to get what you’ve been waiting for?/I’m not a criminal, I’m just a wild child/I’m not a bad girl, I just like it wild style/I’m tough, I’m mean, I’m rough/Just say the safe word when you’ve had enough,” during the chorus.\n“I don’t gotta listen to you/ You’re not thе boss of me!”\nElsewhere in her 18-track setlist, Halsey treated fans to a variety of songs from her discography. Some of the songs they performed included ‘Roman Holiday’, ‘You Should Be Sad’, ‘Ego’, ‘Colors’ and more.\nHalsey’s Sips & Sounds 2025 setlist was:\nRecommended\n‘Bad at Love’ (Decades Remix)\n‘Panic Attack’ (Extended)\n‘Roman Holiday’\n‘Graveyard’\n‘Hometown’\n‘You Should Be Sad’\n‘Ego’\n‘Closer’ (The Chainsmokers cover) (Rock Remix)\n‘Colors’ (Rock Remix)\n‘Lonely is the Muse’\n‘The Lighthouse’\n‘You Asked for This’\n‘Safeword’ (Live debut)\n‘Gasoline’ (Reimagined)\n‘Hurricane’\n‘I am Not a Woman, I’m a God’\n‘Nightmare’ (Reprise)\n‘Without Me’\nLast month, Halsey revealed that she’d be performing some new songs on her 2025 North American ‘For My Last Trick’ tour.\nIn a five-star review of ‘The Great Impersonator’, NME wrote: “Looking back through her recent catalogue, ‘Manic’ is more stylistically diverse, ‘If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power’ more musically ambitious, but ‘The Great Impersonator’ is Halsey’s most honest album – that is if you choose to believe her.”\nThe record also landed at Number 39 on NME‘s 50 best albums of 2024 list, with the single ‘Lonely Is The Muse’ earning a place in our 50 best songs of the year run-down.\nHalsey’s North American headline tour is due to begin this spring, featuring support from Evanescence, Alvvays and more.

Find Muse tour …\nContent: 10/10\nby naze on 5/22/24Rating: 5 out of 5cool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\nThere are no upcoming concerts in United States\nDon't worry, there are other concerts available below\nMuse in Concert\nArmed with guitars, synths, and one killer falsetto, British rockers Muse have been playing and performing like it's the end of the world since the mid-1990s. The trio of lead vocalist and guitarist Matt Bellamy, bassist Chris Wolstenholme, and drummer Dominic Howard first came together in Devon, England, as goth band Rocket Baby Dolls. At the time, their riveting showmanship on stage was already starting to show: In 1994, they won a local \"battle of the bands\" contest, switched their name to the trimmer and tidier Muse, and have since skyrocketed into one of the most electrifying stadium acts in the world.\nOver their first few years, they played gigs around England and eventually recorded their first set of material, a self-titled EP, in 1998. But it wasn't until follow-up EP ‘Muscle Museum' that they first reached the NME Indie Singles Chart, and started accumulating comparisons to Radiohead. Their 1999 debut album ‘Showbiz' would follow, and its sci-fi-inspired alt-rock landed them on numerous European charts. Muse's bombastic eclecticism would only grow from here. Their next round of albums incorporated more touches of classical music, church organs, Mellotrons, and various experimental effects, and by their third album, ‘Absolution,' they'd kicked off a consistent streak of topping the U.K. charts.\nSince 2006's ‘Black Holes and Revelations,' they began to conquer the U.S. as well, and their live shows became more and more extravagant as their music became more and more dystopic. The high-tech worldwide tours backing 2009's ‘1984'-inspired ‘The Resistance' and 2012's ‘The Second Law' would prove them to be a must-see event, with massive light displays and film projections, pyrotechnics, and even an LED suit for Bellamy. Their next album, ‘Drones,' scored them a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2015, and gave them a good reason to incorporate real drones into their Drones Tour. Muse would continue on the surreal sci-fi path with 2018's synth-pop release ‘Simulation Theory' and a 2019 tour — quite possibly their most mind-blowing yet.\nEncore\nEncore\nEncore\nEncore\ncool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\nMuse's concert was INSANE! The visuals, the sound, the energy – it was all off the charts. An absolute rock revolution that blew my mind! 🤩🎤🎶\nI’ve seen Muse in concert around 7 times, and they kill it every time! They’re amazing performers and they sound outrageous, Live! Every time they’re in N.Y, I make sure to go see them! Love them :-)\nAbsolutely amazing. They killed it. They really go all out. Definitely want to see them again.\nThis was more than a concert, it was full-on performance, explosive and energetic, memorable and impactful. Seamless stream of music and lights and confetti and fire. I'm generally too shy to be very vocal in social settings like this, but I had no voice after this concert as I couldn't help but join in the singing and screaming with excitement. How cool to have that experience in a room full of thousands of other fans all collectively vibing with the band together. It was so amazing, I want to do it again!\nThis is the first time I have seen Muse. Absolutely, phenomenal performance. Great sound. Great light show. Everything. Solid.\nIt was an amazing show with a great line up, Highly Suspect and Evanescence were amazing. Muse went over the top (in a great way), If was more than just preforming music, they created a whole show to go with their music. I would see them again.\nMuse is one of the best bands, a new experience of Rock, very unique style, sound, lyrics, everything! Best of the best!!!\nI’m always be in love with their rock style and the way Matthew is singing and April was my lucky month which could see them in concert . It’s ridiculous how good they are..They were brilliant and full of energy. Their performance absolutely awesome they are one of the best rock band🏻\nMy inner high school emo self was SO happy!! The girl next to me and I were in happy tears at some point reliving our high school emo days. Beautiful moments bringing strangers together!",

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.",

Matthew’s superb vocals along with Chris’ bass playing (my favourite) and Dominic’s drumming including gorgeous cinematics in between songs plus the structures built for the stage, pyrotechnics and confetti made the show really engaging and made everyone’s night much better. A spectacular show for a band that has been together for about 25 years and still bringing their signature electronic rock sounds as the heart of every show today, I can’t wait to catch them at Toronto again when they come back!",

Four gigs were announced in total, all in the UK and all outdoor stadium gigs. As expected, more tour dates were announced throughout the following months, leading up to the tour itself. Bellamy mentioned, in an interview with Zane Lowe in August of 2022, that the tour would take place between January and July of 2023, starting in Mexico, continuing in the U.S. and Canada, and finishing in Europe.[1]\nMexico\nMexican dates were announced on October 7th, 2022. The tour included stops at Monterrey's Estadio Banorte, Guadalajara's Arena VFG and Mexico City's Foro Sol, spreading over two dates, on both 22nd and 23rd of January. The additional date in Mexico City, on 23rd, was announced on October 27th, 2022.\nThe short Mexican leg took place before the U.S. legs.\nUnited States & Canada\nTaking place after the short Mexican leg, U.S. and Canada legs exclusively featured indoor shows, with the only exception being the gig at Shaky Knees festival in Atlanta. Most tour dates were announced on September 29th, 2022. Two additional gigs in Montreal and Quebec were announced on October 6th, while additional gigs in St. Louis and Oakland were announced on October 17th.\nThe tour featured two legs and one \"lone\" show. The first leg began at Chicago's United Center on February 25th, and ended at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center on March 19th. The second leg started with the show at Phoenix's Desert Diamond Arena on April 2nd, ending with a gig at Salt Lake City's Vivint Smart Home Arena. The final show in the U.S. took place on May 6th, at the afforementioned Shaky Knees festival.\nEurope\nStadium gigs\nAs mentioned above, the first gigs of the tour that were announced were the UK gigs. These took place in Plymouth's Home Park on May 27th, Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium on June 20th, Glasgow's Bellahouston Park on June 23rd and Milton Keynes's National Bowl on June 25th. The rest of the tour was announced afterwards. Additional European dates have been announced on January 20th, 2023, including the first show of the tour in Spain, in Santander's El Sardinero on July 4th, and a gig at Nancy's Zénith amphitheatre on July 6th, where they be played a headlining show, as part of the Nancy Open Air festival.\nThe rest of the European dates were announced soon afterwards. The European features Muse's first shows in the cities of Wiener Neustadt, Austria and Santander, Spain. Additionally, the show at Milton Keynes's National Bowl was Muse's first live show at the site. The last time Muse were at Milton Keynes before, was during the rehearsals for The Resistance stadium tour, in 2010. Additionally, Muse played in the city of The Hague, Netherlands after almost 23 years, and Lyon, France after about a decade.\nThe European tour featured an indoor production, scaled for an outdoor gig, and included both stadium and festival shows.\nArena gigs\nOn June 26th, the band announced indoor arena gigs for the UK and Ireland in autumn, with Nova Twins supporting.[2] The gigs announced are set to take place in Dublin's 3Arena on September 27th, Manchester's AO Arena on September 29th and London's The O2 on October 1st and 2nd.\nTravel packages\nThree travel packages were available to buy for three dates off of the European leg of the tour; Cologne (June 9th), Paris (July 8th) and Milan (July 22nd). Each travel package included, together with two tickets, a two-night stay at a hotel (king or twin bed rooms options are available). Hotels which were included are Cologne's Pullman, Paris's Marriott Ambassador and Milan's Marriott. An optional third night add-on was also included in each package, for additional cost. Additionally, two exclusive posters, commemorating Muse's performance at each venue in the city (RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Stade de France in Paris and San Siro in Milan) were included in each travel package, as were on-site hosts, and, for the Cologne gig, a roundtrip fare on the metro to the stadium.\nMore on the travel packages can be seen here.\nAsia\nAfter being teased on February 16th by the band on social media, the band announced the only Asian gig of the tour in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, on February 22nd. The open-air gig took place at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium on 29th July 2023.[3][4] The show marked the first Muse gig that took place in the country since 2007.\nSaudi Arabia\nIn 2024, Muse took time off touring to focus on families and solo projects. Despite that, two gigs took place in Saudi Arabia in December; The first one in Abu Dhabi, at F1, and another one, in Riyadh, at the Banban Festival.\nSupporting acts\nThje first support act to be announced were Royal Blood, who opened for Muse during the European open-air leg (exceptions being the Nancy and Glasgow gigs, aswell as festivals). For the U.S. shows, Evanescence were announced as the main opening act. Additional support acts for U.S. shows were announced on November 9th, 2022; One Ok Rock supported Muse during the first half of the U.S. leg (between Chicago and Philadelphia gigs), while Highly Suspect will be supporting Muse during the second half of the U.S. leg (between the Phoenix and Salt Lake City gigs).[5] On January 13th, 2023, The Warning were announced as the support act for the Mexico gigs.[6]\nOn March 22nd, both The Warning and One Ok Rock were announced as additional support acts for select European dates. The Warning supported Muse on the U.K. leg (plus one stop in Lyon, France), while One Ok Rock supported them on the rest of the European leg (excluding festivals, and the Glasgow gig). Joining the two is Twin Atlantic, who opened together with The Warning on the afforementioned Bellahouston Park gig in Glasgow.[7] A support change was made for the gig in Bern, Switzerland, as One Ok Rock couldn't perform at due to unforeseen circumstances; Replacing them was Emilie Zoé. Kyoto Protocol were announced as the support act for the Kuala Lumpur gig only a few weeks before the show itself, on July 11th, 2023.\nOn June 26th, alongside the annoucement of the UK and Ireland indoor gigs, Nova Twins were announced to be supporting Muse on these gigs.[8]\nProduction\nAs with the previous large headlining tour, the Simulation Theory World Tour, this tour features indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The stage set-up in general is a hybrid between the 2022 festivals tour and the autumn theatre tour setups. It includes an inflatable rotating figure of Will the Hacker as a backdrop, together with a grid of light fixtures, similar to the one from the theatre tour. Joining Will the Hacker is a new figure nicknamed \"Baph\".\nThe festival setup (which was also used during the Mexican leg of the tour) bears more resemblance to the 2022 summer festivals setup, with the only major difference being an addition of the lighting grid, replacing the LED strip lights behind the band. An inflatable figure of Will is present throughout the entire show, including the encore, while the setlists themselves (exceptions being the Mexican shows) include no rotations, and are more akin to the 2022 summer festivals setlists\nThe indoor setup, which premiered at the North American leg, features a stage with transparent floor, allowing for it to be illuminated from below, with an addition of a larger B-stage, six moving glass panels with lights, hung above the band, more lights on the back-grid, and, as mentioned above, an inflatable figure named \"Baph\", joining \"Will\", getting inflated for the encore. Because of the differences, the setlists for the North American shows also got \"revamped\".\nThe stage for the European outdoor setup had the same core of elements as the indoor arena setup , with an addition of two stage wings on either side, aswell as larger LED screens on both sides of the stage, equipped with light fixtures. It also featured a longer runway to the B-stage, with the B-stage itself being slightly bigger than it was for the indoor shows. \"Will\" is now equipped with a LED screen inside of his mask, an exclusive to the stadium/headlining shows, as festivals still use the older and smaller version of the figure. The full outdoor set up was officially revealed on Muse's Instagram[9], a day prior to the first gig in Plymouth, on May 26th, after pictures and videos of the stage being set up surfaced on social media a few days before.[10]\nFor the Saudi Arabia gigs in 2024, the core of the production remained the same, however, the burning WOTP logo was ditched.\nShort tour documentaries\nA series of short documentaries was set to be released throughout the tour itself, shot and edited by Muse's WOTP tour photographer Johann Ramos (known as \"The Work of Jar\") and Centreline Films, posted on Muse's YouTube channel.\nSix documentaries have been released so far. The first one is a recap of the first leg of the tour in Mexico, the second one goes over the rehearsals, which took place in California's Ontario, aswell as the Chicago show. The third one looks back at week one of the U.S. leg of the tour, the fourth one talks about the homecoming Plymouth show, and week one of the European leg, can be seen here. The fifht one shows various clips and highlights from the European stadium tour. The sixth features Matt talking about Kill or Be Killed, while showing pre-show backstage footage.\nAverage Setlist\nDuring the January leg in Mexico, the setlist remained relatively unchaged from the shows off of the 2022 festivals tour. This changed with leg 1 in the U.S., starting in Chicago, in February, when the show was updated, in turn bringing in a new setlist format. This first indoor leg in the U.S. brought in live premieres of Verona and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental). STT Interstitials 1 and 3 returned as Simulation Theory Theme, which was played from tape, mashed up with [JFK], acting as an intro to Kill or Be Killed. Additionally, Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation version was played from tape, as an interstitial, before Compliance. Also returning after several years were Resistance, Undisclosed Desires and the shortened version of Isolated System. Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses) was also played, making this the second big headlining tour to feature Assassin, played in full since the Black Holes And Revelations Tour, with it previously being only played during The Drones World Tour 2015/16.\nWith the announcement of the Absolution XX Anniversary boxset in September of 2023, the band looks to have put an emphasis on songs off of the album during the indoor autumn leg in the UK and Ireland, with both Butterflies & Hurricanes and Apocalypse Please played on the first night of the leg in Dublin. Both songs were played for the first time in 6 years and 7 years respectively. During the leg, Stockholm Syndrome replaced Kill or Be Killed in its slot in Manchester. Space Dementia also made a return.\nThe setlist changed the most with the 2024 Saudi Arabia gigs, with the usual opener (Will ofthe People) replaced with the Simulation Theory Theme / JFK mashup (played from tape) and Won't Stand Down.

Generally, the setlists for these shows were more or less the same to these of the Will of the People Festivals Tour.\n- With the start of the U.S. tour, the production was updated, in turn also changing the setlists - Scrambling songs on the setlist and changing its template, replacing The Gallery with Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Remix) and adding songs like Verona, The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental) and Isolated System to the sets.\n- A few gigs into the U.S. leg, Undisclosed Desires was put into rotation with Resistance.\n- Liberation was in rotation with Verona on double nights during the NA leg of the tour, which were only the second night of both Quebec City and Montreal. Verona was dropped for the UK indoor leg with Apocalypse Please and Space Dementia played in rotation in its place.\n- The Shaky Knees Festival gig featured a shorter setlist with a few changes compared to the indoor gig setlists; Thought Contagion was played earlier in the set, Isolated System was played before Supermassive Black Hole and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality)'s instrumental version and JFK / Simulation Theory Theme intro were ditched from the set. The same setlist was played at the NorthSide festival in Denmark.\n- For the stadium shows, Resistance and Undisclosed Desires were brought out of rotation and were both played at each show.\n- The stadium shows also featured less songs in the first rotation slot, these being Bliss and Map of the Problematique (with the latter only being played three times so far). Stockholm Syndrome joined the two at the Rome gig.\n- Showbiz was played instead of Knights of Cydonia at the Werchter Festival gig after technical issues meant the latter song couldn't be played. This made it the first gig in which all 9 studio albums were represented.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2024-12-13 | Banban (Soundstorm Festival) | Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |\n| 2024-12-08 | Du Arena (Formula 1 Grand Prix) | Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates |\n| 2023-11-04 | Foro Pegaso (Hell & Heaven Festival) | Toluca de Lerdo, Mexico |\n| 2023-10-02 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-10-01 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-09-29 | AO Arena | Manchester, UK |\n| 2023-09-27 | 3Arena | Dublin, Ireland |\n| 2023-07-29 | Bukit Kiara Equestrian Resort | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |\n| 2023-07-22 | Stadio Giuseppe Meazza | Milan, Italy |\n| 2023-07-18 | Stadio Olimpico | Rome, Italy |\n| 2023-07-15 | Stade Orange Vélodrome | Marseille, France |\n| 2023-07-12 | BernExpo Areal | Bern, Switzerland |\n| 2023-07-08 | Stade de France | Paris, France |\n| 2023-07-06 | Zénith de Nancy (Nancy Open Air) | Nancy, France |\n| 2023-07-04 | Campos de Sport de El Sardinero | Santander, Spain |\n| 2023-07-01 | Festivalpark Werchter (Rock Werchter) | Werchter, Belgium |\n| 2023-06-29 | Matmut Atlantique | Bordeaux, France |\n| 2023-06-25 | The National Bowl | Milton Keynes, UK |\n| 2023-06-23 | Bellahouston Park | Glasgow, UK |\n| 2023-06-20 | John Smith's Stadium | Huddersfield, UK |\n| 2023-06-18 | Flugplatz Neuhausen (Southside Festival) | Neuhausen ob Eck, Germany |\n| 2023-06-17 | Eichenring (Hurricane Festival) | Scheessel, Germany |\n| 2023-06-15 | Groupama Stadium | Lyon, France |\n| 2023-06-11 | Park 360 (Rock for People) | Hradec Králové, Czech Republic |\n| 2023-06-09 | RheinEnergieStadion | Cologne, Germany |\n| 2023-06-07 | Malieveld | The Hague, Netherlands |\n| 2023-06-03 | Stadion Wiener Neustadt | Wiener Neustadt, Austria |\n| 2023-06-01 | Eskelunden (NorthSide) | Århus, Denmark |\n| 2023-05-27 | Home Park | Plymouth, UK |\n| 2023-05-06 | Central Park (Shaky Knees Music Festival) | Atlanta, GA, USA |\n| 2023-04-20 | Vivint Arena | Salt Lake City, UT, USA |\n| 2023-04-18 | Climate Pledge Arena | Seattle, WA, USA |\n| 2023-04-16 | Moda Center | Portland, OR, USA |\n| 2023-04-14 | Oakland Arena | Oakland, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-12 | Honda Center | Anaheim, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-10 | Pechanga Arena | San Diego, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-08 | T-Mobile Arena | Las Vegas, NV, USA |\n| 2023-04-06 | Crypto.com Arena | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-04 | Ball Arena | Denver, CO, USA |\n| 2023-04-02 | Desert Diamond Arena | Phoenix, AZ, USA |\n| 2023-03-19 | Wells Fargo Center | Philadelphia, PA, USA |\n| 2023-03-17 | Madison Square Garden | New York City, NY, USA |\n| 2023-03-15 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-14 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-12 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-11 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-09 | Scotiabank Arena | Toronto, ON, Canada |\n| 2023-03-07 | Nationwide Arena | Columbus, OH, USA |\n| 2023-03-05 | Chaifetz Arena | St. Louis, MO, USA |\n| 2023-03-03 | Dickies Arena | Fort Worth, TX, USA |\n| 2023-03-02 | Toyota Center | Houston, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-28 | Moody Center | Austin, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-26 | Target Center | Minneapolis, MN, USA |\n| 2023-02-25 | United Center | Chicago, IL, USA |\n| 2023-01-23 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-22 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-20 | Arena V.F.G. | Guadalajara, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-18 | Estadio Banorte | Monterrey, Mexico |\nSee also\nReferences\n- ↑ https://youtu.be/AMvtyphl9rA?t=2297\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CpMk5jDBxEG/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1628321276896112641\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CnXcXiNNSFy/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1638587091020914713/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/Csuf6rlqKCS/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZn26TSifb/",

Sign up for event updates.\nAbout Muse Tickets\nThe English rock band, Muse, was formed in 1994 after a few friends won a local battle of the band's competition. After playing gigs around London and Manchester, Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999. Over the next few years, the group experimented with instruments such as the church organ, animal bones and an expanded drum kit, giving their next album a classical yet romantic influence. In 2001, the group released their sophomore album, Origins of Symmetry, which showcased their newly developed melancholic sound. Muse had their big break after releasing their third album, Absolution, which debuted at No. 1 in the UK and produced their first top ten hit, ‘Time is Running Out. ’ Following this success, they released their third album, Black Holes and Revelations, which incorporated electronic and pop elements. Muse is known for their lyrical albums, all of which are inspired by introspective themes, books and global issues. Each album represents a different concept, such as relationships, science fiction and drone warfare. Muses’ ability to create a cohesive sound while blending many different styles is nothing short of impressive, making it no surprise that they have won multiple Grammys and sold millions of albums worldwide.\nHow much are Muse tickets?\nThere are no upcoming events for Muse.

Stay updated …\nContent: Muse\nMuse tour dates: 5 concerts in 5 countries\nAbout Muse\nMuse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards) and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion).\nMuse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, incorporating wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.\nBlack Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 1980s groups such as Depeche Mode, displayed in singles such as \"Supermassive Black Hole\". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound.\nMuse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, winning the Grammys for Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones, two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.",

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\nInformation\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\nThe Show\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \"WOTP\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \"Women will be what she was born to be\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\nMedia\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\nSetlist\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)",

First show of the U.S. leg of the tour.\nInformation\nAnnounced on September 29th, 2022, tickets came on-sale October 7th at 10AM, local time. Members pre-sale began October 4th, at 10AM, local. To access the pre-sale code, members account must've been createad prior to September 19th, 2022.\nMuse were supported by Evanescence and One Ok Rock.\nThe Show\nThe Setlist\n- The setlist overall remained somewhat similar to both the Mexican leg and the festival tour the previous year - but with numerous changes and additions.\n- Verona and Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley remix both made their live debuts. The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\nProduction and Staging\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\n- The stage featured the burning \"WOTP\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\n- The \"Will the Hacker\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \"Baph\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona. Rain confetti was also released during Isolated System.\nTimetable\n- 16:30 - Concert club doors [9]\n- 17:30 - General admission\n- 18:30 - One Ok Rock\n- 19:30 - Evanescence\n- 21:00 - Muse\nMedia\nThe official aftermovie can be seen here.\nSetlist\n- Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Interlude + Hysteria + Cherub Rock\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Bliss (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed intro + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) [watch]\n- Compliance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Thought Contagion [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Verona [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Isolated System (shortened) [watch]\n- Resistance [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Madness [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - We Are Fucking Fucked [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black 3.0 #2, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental) [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype) - Supermassive Black Hole w/ Just Like This riff [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended) + Sweet Child O' Mine\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Mirror 2.0, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Behold, The Glove\n(aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Uprising (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Red Alert, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Prelude + Starlight\n(graphite finish red-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/ JFK + Kill or Be Killed [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\nGallery\nMatt on Will's shoulder during The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Version\nReferences\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center\n- ↑ https://www.ticketmaster.com/muse-will-of-the-people-tour-chicago-illinois-02-25-2023/event/04005D3315B43BD4\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://www.unitedcenter.com/events/2023/02/25/muse-will-of-the-people-tour/",

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\nInformation\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\nThe Show\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \"WOTP\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \"Women will be what she was born to be\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\nMedia\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\nSetlist\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)",

First show of the U.S. leg of the tour.\nInformation\nAnnounced on September 29th, 2022, tickets came on-sale October 7th at 10AM, local time. Members pre-sale began October 4th, at 10AM, local. To access the pre-sale code, members account must've been createad prior to September 19th, 2022.\nMuse were supported by Evanescence and One Ok Rock.\nThe Show\nThe Setlist\n- The setlist overall remained somewhat similar to both the Mexican leg and the festival tour the previous year - but with numerous changes and additions.\n- Verona and Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley remix both made their live debuts. The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\nProduction and Staging\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\n- The stage featured the burning \"WOTP\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\n- The \"Will the Hacker\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \"Baph\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona. Rain confetti was also released during Isolated System.\nTimetable\n- 16:30 - Concert club doors [9]\n- 17:30 - General admission\n- 18:30 - One Ok Rock\n- 19:30 - Evanescence\n- 21:00 - Muse\nMedia\nThe official aftermovie can be seen here.\nSetlist\n- Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Interlude + Hysteria + Cherub Rock\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Bliss (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed intro + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) [watch]\n- Compliance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Thought Contagion [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Verona [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Isolated System (shortened) [watch]\n- Resistance [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Madness [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - We Are Fucking Fucked [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black 3.0 #2, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental) [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype) - Supermassive Black Hole w/ Just Like This riff [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended) + Sweet Child O' Mine\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Mirror 2.0, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Behold, The Glove\n(aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Uprising (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Red Alert, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Prelude + Starlight\n(graphite finish red-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/ JFK + Kill or Be Killed [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\nGallery\nMatt on Will's shoulder during The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Version\nReferences\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center\n- ↑ https://www.ticketmaster.com/muse-will-of-the-people-tour-chicago-illinois-02-25-2023/event/04005D3315B43BD4\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://www.unitedcenter.com/events/2023/02/25/muse-will-of-the-people-tour/",

C. on 2023-06-19Rating: 5 out of 5Late review, but being able to attend the show in Toronto at Scotiabank Arena on March 9, 2023 was amazing! Matthew’s superb vocals along with Chris’ bass playing (my favourite) and Dominic’s drumming including gorgeous cinematics in between songs plus the structures built for the stage, pyrotechnics and confetti made the show really engaging and made everyone’s night much better. A spectacular show for a band that has been together for about 25 years and still bringing their signature electronic rock sounds as the heart of every show today, I can’t wait to catch them at Toronto again when they come back!",

They debuted the track live this past weekend (March 7) during their slot at the Sips & Sounds festival in Austin, TX.\nDuring the performance, Halsey is seen sporting a while babydoll style dress with a black curly mullet hairstyle and black cowboy boots. They are seen jumping and running around the massive stage and its catwalk.\nThe track has nods to artists like Bikini Kill, with Halsey yelling: “Yes, sir, no, sir, on all fours/Are you ready to get what you’ve been waiting for?/I’m not a criminal, I’m just a wild child/I’m not a bad girl, I just like it wild style/I’m tough, I’m mean, I’m rough/Just say the safe word when you’ve had enough,” during the chorus.\n“I don’t gotta listen to you/ You’re not thе boss of me!”\nElsewhere in her 18-track setlist, Halsey treated fans to a variety of songs from her discography. Some of the songs they performed included ‘Roman Holiday’, ‘You Should Be Sad’, ‘Ego’, ‘Colors’ and more.\nHalsey’s Sips & Sounds 2025 setlist was:\nRecommended\n‘Bad at Love’ (Decades Remix)\n‘Panic Attack’ (Extended)\n‘Roman Holiday’\n‘Graveyard’\n‘Hometown’\n‘You Should Be Sad’\n‘Ego’\n‘Closer’ (The Chainsmokers cover) (Rock Remix)\n‘Colors’ (Rock Remix)\n‘Lonely is the Muse’\n‘The Lighthouse’\n‘You Asked for This’\n‘Safeword’ (Live debut)\n‘Gasoline’ (Reimagined)\n‘Hurricane’\n‘I am Not a Woman, I’m a God’\n‘Nightmare’ (Reprise)\n‘Without Me’\nLast month, Halsey revealed that she’d be performing some new songs on her 2025 North American ‘For My Last Trick’ tour.\nIn a five-star review of ‘The Great Impersonator’, NME wrote: “Looking back through her recent catalogue, ‘Manic’ is more stylistically diverse, ‘If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power’ more musically ambitious, but ‘The Great Impersonator’ is Halsey’s most honest album – that is if you choose to believe her.”\nThe record also landed at Number 39 on NME‘s 50 best albums of 2024 list, with the single ‘Lonely Is The Muse’ earning a place in our 50 best songs of the year run-down.\nHalsey’s North American headline tour is due to begin this spring, featuring support from Evanescence, Alvvays and more.

Find Muse tour …\nContent: 10/10\nby naze on 5/22/24Rating: 5 out of 5cool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\nThere are no upcoming concerts in United States\nDon't worry, there are other concerts available below\nMuse in Concert\nArmed with guitars, synths, and one killer falsetto, British rockers Muse have been playing and performing like it's the end of the world since the mid-1990s. The trio of lead vocalist and guitarist Matt Bellamy, bassist Chris Wolstenholme, and drummer Dominic Howard first came together in Devon, England, as goth band Rocket Baby Dolls. At the time, their riveting showmanship on stage was already starting to show: In 1994, they won a local \"battle of the bands\" contest, switched their name to the trimmer and tidier Muse, and have since skyrocketed into one of the most electrifying stadium acts in the world.\nOver their first few years, they played gigs around England and eventually recorded their first set of material, a self-titled EP, in 1998. But it wasn't until follow-up EP ‘Muscle Museum' that they first reached the NME Indie Singles Chart, and started accumulating comparisons to Radiohead. Their 1999 debut album ‘Showbiz' would follow, and its sci-fi-inspired alt-rock landed them on numerous European charts. Muse's bombastic eclecticism would only grow from here. Their next round of albums incorporated more touches of classical music, church organs, Mellotrons, and various experimental effects, and by their third album, ‘Absolution,' they'd kicked off a consistent streak of topping the U.K. charts.\nSince 2006's ‘Black Holes and Revelations,' they began to conquer the U.S. as well, and their live shows became more and more extravagant as their music became more and more dystopic. The high-tech worldwide tours backing 2009's ‘1984'-inspired ‘The Resistance' and 2012's ‘The Second Law' would prove them to be a must-see event, with massive light displays and film projections, pyrotechnics, and even an LED suit for Bellamy. Their next album, ‘Drones,' scored them a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2015, and gave them a good reason to incorporate real drones into their Drones Tour. Muse would continue on the surreal sci-fi path with 2018's synth-pop release ‘Simulation Theory' and a 2019 tour — quite possibly their most mind-blowing yet.\nEncore\nEncore\nEncore\nEncore\ncool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\nMuse's concert was INSANE! The visuals, the sound, the energy – it was all off the charts. An absolute rock revolution that blew my mind! 🤩🎤🎶\nI’ve seen Muse in concert around 7 times, and they kill it every time! They’re amazing performers and they sound outrageous, Live! Every time they’re in N.Y, I make sure to go see them! Love them :-)\nAbsolutely amazing. They killed it. They really go all out. Definitely want to see them again.\nThis was more than a concert, it was full-on performance, explosive and energetic, memorable and impactful. Seamless stream of music and lights and confetti and fire. I'm generally too shy to be very vocal in social settings like this, but I had no voice after this concert as I couldn't help but join in the singing and screaming with excitement. How cool to have that experience in a room full of thousands of other fans all collectively vibing with the band together. It was so amazing, I want to do it again!\nThis is the first time I have seen Muse. Absolutely, phenomenal performance. Great sound. Great light show. Everything. Solid.\nIt was an amazing show with a great line up, Highly Suspect and Evanescence were amazing. Muse went over the top (in a great way), If was more than just preforming music, they created a whole show to go with their music. I would see them again.\nMuse is one of the best bands, a new experience of Rock, very unique style, sound, lyrics, everything! Best of the best!!!\nI’m always be in love with their rock style and the way Matthew is singing and April was my lucky month which could see them in concert . It’s ridiculous how good they are..They were brilliant and full of energy. Their performance absolutely awesome they are one of the best rock band🏻\nMy inner high school emo self was SO happy!! The girl next to me and I were in happy tears at some point reliving our high school emo days. Beautiful moments bringing strangers together!",

Their next tour date …\nContent: Muse is currently touring across 5 countries and has 5 upcoming concerts.\nTheir next tour date is at Unknown venue in Turku, after that they'll be at Hellfest in Clisson.\nSee all your opportunities to see them live below!Santiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.",

Matthew’s superb vocals along with Chris’ bass playing (my favourite) and Dominic’s drumming including gorgeous cinematics in between songs plus the structures built for the stage, pyrotechnics and confetti made the show really engaging and made everyone’s night much better. A spectacular show for a band that has been together for about 25 years and still bringing their signature electronic rock sounds as the heart of every show today, I can’t wait to catch them at Toronto again when they come back!",

Four gigs were announced in total, all in the UK and all outdoor stadium gigs. As expected, more tour dates were announced throughout the following months, leading up to the tour itself. Bellamy mentioned, in an interview with Zane Lowe in August of 2022, that the tour would take place between January and July of 2023, starting in Mexico, continuing in the U.S. and Canada, and finishing in Europe.[1]\nMexico\nMexican dates were announced on October 7th, 2022. The tour included stops at Monterrey's Estadio Banorte, Guadalajara's Arena VFG and Mexico City's Foro Sol, spreading over two dates, on both 22nd and 23rd of January. The additional date in Mexico City, on 23rd, was announced on October 27th, 2022.\nThe short Mexican leg took place before the U.S. legs.\nUnited States & Canada\nTaking place after the short Mexican leg, U.S. and Canada legs exclusively featured indoor shows, with the only exception being the gig at Shaky Knees festival in Atlanta. Most tour dates were announced on September 29th, 2022. Two additional gigs in Montreal and Quebec were announced on October 6th, while additional gigs in St. Louis and Oakland were announced on October 17th.\nThe tour featured two legs and one \"lone\" show. The first leg began at Chicago's United Center on February 25th, and ended at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center on March 19th. The second leg started with the show at Phoenix's Desert Diamond Arena on April 2nd, ending with a gig at Salt Lake City's Vivint Smart Home Arena. The final show in the U.S. took place on May 6th, at the afforementioned Shaky Knees festival.\nEurope\nStadium gigs\nAs mentioned above, the first gigs of the tour that were announced were the UK gigs. These took place in Plymouth's Home Park on May 27th, Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium on June 20th, Glasgow's Bellahouston Park on June 23rd and Milton Keynes's National Bowl on June 25th. The rest of the tour was announced afterwards. Additional European dates have been announced on January 20th, 2023, including the first show of the tour in Spain, in Santander's El Sardinero on July 4th, and a gig at Nancy's Zénith amphitheatre on July 6th, where they be played a headlining show, as part of the Nancy Open Air festival.\nThe rest of the European dates were announced soon afterwards. The European features Muse's first shows in the cities of Wiener Neustadt, Austria and Santander, Spain. Additionally, the show at Milton Keynes's National Bowl was Muse's first live show at the site. The last time Muse were at Milton Keynes before, was during the rehearsals for The Resistance stadium tour, in 2010. Additionally, Muse played in the city of The Hague, Netherlands after almost 23 years, and Lyon, France after about a decade.\nThe European tour featured an indoor production, scaled for an outdoor gig, and included both stadium and festival shows.\nArena gigs\nOn June 26th, the band announced indoor arena gigs for the UK and Ireland in autumn, with Nova Twins supporting.[2] The gigs announced are set to take place in Dublin's 3Arena on September 27th, Manchester's AO Arena on September 29th and London's The O2 on October 1st and 2nd.\nTravel packages\nThree travel packages were available to buy for three dates off of the European leg of the tour; Cologne (June 9th), Paris (July 8th) and Milan (July 22nd). Each travel package included, together with two tickets, a two-night stay at a hotel (king or twin bed rooms options are available). Hotels which were included are Cologne's Pullman, Paris's Marriott Ambassador and Milan's Marriott. An optional third night add-on was also included in each package, for additional cost. Additionally, two exclusive posters, commemorating Muse's performance at each venue in the city (RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Stade de France in Paris and San Siro in Milan) were included in each travel package, as were on-site hosts, and, for the Cologne gig, a roundtrip fare on the metro to the stadium.\nMore on the travel packages can be seen here.\nAsia\nAfter being teased on February 16th by the band on social media, the band announced the only Asian gig of the tour in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, on February 22nd. The open-air gig took place at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium on 29th July 2023.[3][4] The show marked the first Muse gig that took place in the country since 2007.\nSaudi Arabia\nIn 2024, Muse took time off touring to focus on families and solo projects. Despite that, two gigs took place in Saudi Arabia in December; The first one in Abu Dhabi, at F1, and another one, in Riyadh, at the Banban Festival.\nSupporting acts\nThje first support act to be announced were Royal Blood, who opened for Muse during the European open-air leg (exceptions being the Nancy and Glasgow gigs, aswell as festivals). For the U.S. shows, Evanescence were announced as the main opening act. Additional support acts for U.S. shows were announced on November 9th, 2022; One Ok Rock supported Muse during the first half of the U.S. leg (between Chicago and Philadelphia gigs), while Highly Suspect will be supporting Muse during the second half of the U.S. leg (between the Phoenix and Salt Lake City gigs).[5] On January 13th, 2023, The Warning were announced as the support act for the Mexico gigs.[6]\nOn March 22nd, both The Warning and One Ok Rock were announced as additional support acts for select European dates. The Warning supported Muse on the U.K. leg (plus one stop in Lyon, France), while One Ok Rock supported them on the rest of the European leg (excluding festivals, and the Glasgow gig). Joining the two is Twin Atlantic, who opened together with The Warning on the afforementioned Bellahouston Park gig in Glasgow.[7] A support change was made for the gig in Bern, Switzerland, as One Ok Rock couldn't perform at due to unforeseen circumstances; Replacing them was Emilie Zoé. Kyoto Protocol were announced as the support act for the Kuala Lumpur gig only a few weeks before the show itself, on July 11th, 2023.\nOn June 26th, alongside the annoucement of the UK and Ireland indoor gigs, Nova Twins were announced to be supporting Muse on these gigs.[8]\nProduction\nAs with the previous large headlining tour, the Simulation Theory World Tour, this tour features indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The stage set-up in general is a hybrid between the 2022 festivals tour and the autumn theatre tour setups. It includes an inflatable rotating figure of Will the Hacker as a backdrop, together with a grid of light fixtures, similar to the one from the theatre tour. Joining Will the Hacker is a new figure nicknamed \"Baph\".\nThe festival setup (which was also used during the Mexican leg of the tour) bears more resemblance to the 2022 summer festivals setup, with the only major difference being an addition of the lighting grid, replacing the LED strip lights behind the band. An inflatable figure of Will is present throughout the entire show, including the encore, while the setlists themselves (exceptions being the Mexican shows) include no rotations, and are more akin to the 2022 summer festivals setlists\nThe indoor setup, which premiered at the North American leg, features a stage with transparent floor, allowing for it to be illuminated from below, with an addition of a larger B-stage, six moving glass panels with lights, hung above the band, more lights on the back-grid, and, as mentioned above, an inflatable figure named \"Baph\", joining \"Will\", getting inflated for the encore. Because of the differences, the setlists for the North American shows also got \"revamped\".\nThe stage for the European outdoor setup had the same core of elements as the indoor arena setup , with an addition of two stage wings on either side, aswell as larger LED screens on both sides of the stage, equipped with light fixtures. It also featured a longer runway to the B-stage, with the B-stage itself being slightly bigger than it was for the indoor shows. \"Will\" is now equipped with a LED screen inside of his mask, an exclusive to the stadium/headlining shows, as festivals still use the older and smaller version of the figure. The full outdoor set up was officially revealed on Muse's Instagram[9], a day prior to the first gig in Plymouth, on May 26th, after pictures and videos of the stage being set up surfaced on social media a few days before.[10]\nFor the Saudi Arabia gigs in 2024, the core of the production remained the same, however, the burning WOTP logo was ditched.\nShort tour documentaries\nA series of short documentaries was set to be released throughout the tour itself, shot and edited by Muse's WOTP tour photographer Johann Ramos (known as \"The Work of Jar\") and Centreline Films, posted on Muse's YouTube channel.\nSix documentaries have been released so far. The first one is a recap of the first leg of the tour in Mexico, the second one goes over the rehearsals, which took place in California's Ontario, aswell as the Chicago show. The third one looks back at week one of the U.S. leg of the tour, the fourth one talks about the homecoming Plymouth show, and week one of the European leg, can be seen here. The fifht one shows various clips and highlights from the European stadium tour. The sixth features Matt talking about Kill or Be Killed, while showing pre-show backstage footage.\nAverage Setlist\nDuring the January leg in Mexico, the setlist remained relatively unchaged from the shows off of the 2022 festivals tour. This changed with leg 1 in the U.S., starting in Chicago, in February, when the show was updated, in turn bringing in a new setlist format. This first indoor leg in the U.S. brought in live premieres of Verona and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental). STT Interstitials 1 and 3 returned as Simulation Theory Theme, which was played from tape, mashed up with [JFK], acting as an intro to Kill or Be Killed. Additionally, Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation version was played from tape, as an interstitial, before Compliance. Also returning after several years were Resistance, Undisclosed Desires and the shortened version of Isolated System. Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses) was also played, making this the second big headlining tour to feature Assassin, played in full since the Black Holes And Revelations Tour, with it previously being only played during The Drones World Tour 2015/16.\nWith the announcement of the Absolution XX Anniversary boxset in September of 2023, the band looks to have put an emphasis on songs off of the album during the indoor autumn leg in the UK and Ireland, with both Butterflies & Hurricanes and Apocalypse Please played on the first night of the leg in Dublin. Both songs were played for the first time in 6 years and 7 years respectively. During the leg, Stockholm Syndrome replaced Kill or Be Killed in its slot in Manchester. Space Dementia also made a return.\nThe setlist changed the most with the 2024 Saudi Arabia gigs, with the usual opener (Will ofthe People) replaced with the Simulation Theory Theme / JFK mashup (played from tape) and Won't Stand Down. Starlight was also chosen to replace Knights of Cydonia as a closer for the first time in 11 years. Bellamy's own piece Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four audiobook soundtrack) was also played live for the first time before Time Is Running Out.\nMexican shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Pressure / Map of the Problematique / Bliss\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased / New Born\n- The Gallery\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Time Is Running Out\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nU.S./Canada/Ireland/UK indoor shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Citizen Erased / New Born / Stockholm Syndrome / Pressure / Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses version) / Butterflies & Hurricanes (UK + Ireland only)\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona / Liberation (Canada only) / Apocalypse Please (UK + Ireland only) / Space Dementia (UK only)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Resistance / Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed / Stockholm Syndrome (Manchester only)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/stadium shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome\n- Resistance\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/US festival shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Thought Contagion\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nSaudi Arabia shows set\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Resistance\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Madness\n- Thought Contagion\n- Pressure (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Hanging in Victory Square (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEncore\n- Isolated System (shortened) (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Undisclosed Desires (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nNotes & Exceptions\n- During the four Mexican shows, rotation slots got swapped around the setlists. Generally, the setlists for these shows were more or less the same to these of the Will of the People Festivals Tour.\n- With the start of the U.S. tour, the production was updated, in turn also changing the setlists - Scrambling songs on the setlist and changing its template, replacing The Gallery with Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Remix) and adding songs like Verona, The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental) and Isolated System to the sets.\n- A few gigs into the U.S. leg, Undisclosed Desires was put into rotation with Resistance.\n- Liberation was in rotation with Verona on double nights during the NA leg of the tour, which were only the second night of both Quebec City and Montreal. Verona was dropped for the UK indoor leg with Apocalypse Please and Space Dementia played in rotation in its place.\n- The Shaky Knees Festival gig featured a shorter setlist with a few changes compared to the indoor gig setlists; Thought Contagion was played earlier in the set, Isolated System was played before Supermassive Black Hole and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality)'s instrumental version and JFK / Simulation Theory Theme intro were ditched from the set. The same setlist was played at the NorthSide festival in Denmark.\n- For the stadium shows, Resistance and Undisclosed Desires were brought out of rotation and were both played at each show.\n- The stadium shows also featured less songs in the first rotation slot, these being Bliss and Map of the Problematique (with the latter only being played three times so far). Stockholm Syndrome joined the two at the Rome gig.\n- Showbiz was played instead of Knights of Cydonia at the Werchter Festival gig after technical issues meant the latter song couldn't be played. This made it the first gig in which all 9 studio albums were represented.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2024-12-13 | Banban (Soundstorm Festival) | Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |\n| 2024-12-08 | Du Arena (Formula 1 Grand Prix) | Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates |\n| 2023-11-04 | Foro Pegaso (Hell & Heaven Festival) | Toluca de Lerdo, Mexico |\n| 2023-10-02 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-10-01 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-09-29 | AO Arena | Manchester, UK |\n| 2023-09-27 | 3Arena | Dublin, Ireland |\n| 2023-07-29 | Bukit Kiara Equestrian Resort | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |\n| 2023-07-22 | Stadio Giuseppe Meazza | Milan, Italy |\n| 2023-07-18 | Stadio Olimpico | Rome, Italy |\n| 2023-07-15 | Stade Orange Vélodrome | Marseille, France |\n| 2023-07-12 | BernExpo Areal | Bern, Switzerland |\n| 2023-07-08 | Stade de France | Paris, France |\n| 2023-07-06 | Zénith de Nancy (Nancy Open Air) | Nancy, France |\n| 2023-07-04 | Campos de Sport de El Sardinero | Santander, Spain |\n| 2023-07-01 | Festivalpark Werchter (Rock Werchter) | Werchter, Belgium |\n| 2023-06-29 | Matmut Atlantique | Bordeaux, France |\n| 2023-06-25 | The National Bowl | Milton Keynes, UK |\n| 2023-06-23 | Bellahouston Park | Glasgow, UK |\n| 2023-06-20 | John Smith's Stadium | Huddersfield, UK |\n| 2023-06-18 | Flugplatz Neuhausen (Southside Festival) | Neuhausen ob Eck, Germany |\n| 2023-06-17 | Eichenring (Hurricane Festival) | Scheessel, Germany |\n| 2023-06-15 | Groupama Stadium | Lyon, France |\n| 2023-06-11 | Park 360 (Rock for People) | Hradec Králové, Czech Republic |\n| 2023-06-09 | RheinEnergieStadion | Cologne, Germany |\n| 2023-06-07 | Malieveld | The Hague, Netherlands |\n| 2023-06-03 | Stadion Wiener Neustadt | Wiener Neustadt, Austria |\n| 2023-06-01 | Eskelunden (NorthSide) | Århus, Denmark |\n| 2023-05-27 | Home Park | Plymouth, UK |\n| 2023-05-06 | Central Park (Shaky Knees Music Festival) | Atlanta, GA, USA |\n| 2023-04-20 | Vivint Arena | Salt Lake City, UT, USA |\n| 2023-04-18 | Climate Pledge Arena | Seattle, WA, USA |\n| 2023-04-16 | Moda Center | Portland, OR, USA |\n| 2023-04-14 | Oakland Arena | Oakland, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-12 | Honda Center | Anaheim, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-10 | Pechanga Arena | San Diego, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-08 | T-Mobile Arena | Las Vegas, NV, USA |\n| 2023-04-06 | Crypto.com Arena | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-04 | Ball Arena | Denver, CO, USA |\n| 2023-04-02 | Desert Diamond Arena | Phoenix, AZ, USA |\n| 2023-03-19 | Wells Fargo Center | Philadelphia, PA, USA |\n| 2023-03-17 | Madison Square Garden | New York City, NY, USA |\n| 2023-03-15 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-14 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-12 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-11 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-09 | Scotiabank Arena | Toronto, ON, Canada |\n| 2023-03-07 | Nationwide Arena | Columbus, OH, USA |\n| 2023-03-05 | Chaifetz Arena | St. Louis, MO, USA |\n| 2023-03-03 | Dickies Arena | Fort Worth, TX, USA |\n| 2023-03-02 | Toyota Center | Houston, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-28 | Moody Center | Austin, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-26 | Target Center | Minneapolis, MN, USA |\n| 2023-02-25 | United Center | Chicago, IL, USA |\n| 2023-01-23 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-22 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-20 | Arena V.F.G. | Guadalajara, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-18 | Estadio Banorte | Monterrey, Mexico |\nSee also\nReferences\n- ↑ https://youtu.be/AMvtyphl9rA?t=2297\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CpMk5jDBxEG/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1628321276896112641\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CnXcXiNNSFy/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1638587091020914713/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/Csuf6rlqKCS/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZn26TSifb/",

Sign up for event updates.\nAbout Muse Tickets\nThe English rock band, Muse, was formed in 1994 after a few friends won a local battle of the band's competition. After playing gigs around London and Manchester, Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999. Over the next few years, the group experimented with instruments such as the church organ, animal bones and an expanded drum kit, giving their next album a classical yet romantic influence. In 2001, the group released their sophomore album, Origins of Symmetry, which showcased their newly developed melancholic sound. Muse had their big break after releasing their third album, Absolution, which debuted at No. 1 in the UK and produced their first top ten hit, ‘Time is Running Out. ’ Following this success, they released their third album, Black Holes and Revelations, which incorporated electronic and pop elements. Muse is known for their lyrical albums, all of which are inspired by introspective themes, books and global issues. Each album represents a different concept, such as relationships, science fiction and drone warfare. Muses’ ability to create a cohesive sound while blending many different styles is nothing short of impressive, making it no surprise that they have won multiple Grammys and sold millions of albums worldwide.\nHow much are Muse tickets?\nThere are no upcoming events for Muse.

Once indoors at Mandalay Bay, once outdoor at Aftershock in Sacramento. This was, BY FAR, the best show I've seen them do. Out of the hundreds of shows I've been to in my life, this was in the top 5.

Stay updated …\nContent: Muse\nMuse tour dates: 5 concerts in 5 countries\nAbout Muse\nMuse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards) and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion).\nMuse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, incorporating wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.\nBlack Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 1980s groups such as Depeche Mode, displayed in singles such as \"Supermassive Black Hole\". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound.\nMuse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, winning the Grammys for Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones, two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.",

See all your …\nContent: Muse is currently touring across 5 countries and has 5 upcoming concerts.\nTheir next tour date is at Unknown venue in Turku, after that they'll be at Hellfest in Clisson.\nSee all your opportunities to see them live below!Santiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.",

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Knights of Cydonia,\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\nThe \"Complejo al Río\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \"campo trasero\" you couldn't see anything.\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \"NOOO\" which meant hearing even less.\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nOver the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001.\nFrom humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled.\nThe band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe.\nFrom that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding.\nWith Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic.\nSince their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences.\nAs the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims.\nNo matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return.\nSantiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nI had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena.\nMuse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album.\nMy only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out.\nGreat performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole.\nWe came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin. I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again. It was so worth it. They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers. They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool. I can watch it again if I want. So, so worth it. The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered. It's hard to describe, but it looked really good. The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired. It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well. It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse. If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes.\nAn impressive start with \"Psycho\" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, \"Drones\", but also included some classics as \"Plug In Baby\", \"Stockholm Syndrome\", and an amazing performance of \"Citizen Erased\", a song from \"Origin of Symmetry\" rarely played in the latest years shows.\nThe stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics.\nBellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic \"Time Is Running Out\", as well as \"Starlight\" and the whole chorus for \"Uprising\".\nA great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment.\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.\nSaw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon.\nWant to see Muse in concert?

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

See all your …\nContent: Muse is currently touring across 5 countries and has 5 upcoming concerts.\nTheir next tour date is at Unknown venue in Turku, after that they'll be at Hellfest in Clisson.\nSee all your opportunities to see them live below!Santiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.",

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Knights of Cydonia,\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\nThe \"Complejo al Río\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \"campo trasero\" you couldn't see anything.\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \"NOOO\" which meant hearing even less.\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nOver the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001.\nFrom humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled.\nThe band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe.\nFrom that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding.\nWith Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic.\nSince their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences.\nAs the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims.\nNo matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return.\nSantiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nI had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena.\nMuse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album.\nMy only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out.\nGreat performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole.\nWe came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin. I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again. It was so worth it. They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers. They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool. I can watch it again if I want. So, so worth it. The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered. It's hard to describe, but it looked really good. The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired. It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well. It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse. If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes.\nAn impressive start with \"Psycho\" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, \"Drones\", but also included some classics as \"Plug In Baby\", \"Stockholm Syndrome\", and an amazing performance of \"Citizen Erased\", a song from \"Origin of Symmetry\" rarely played in the latest years shows.\nThe stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics.\nBellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic \"Time Is Running Out\", as well as \"Starlight\" and the whole chorus for \"Uprising\".\nA great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment.\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.\nSaw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon.\nWant to see Muse in concert?

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

C. on 2023-06-19Rating: 5 out of 5Late review, but being able to attend the show in Toronto at Scotiabank Arena on March 9, 2023 was amazing! Matthew’s superb vocals along with Chris’ bass playing (my favourite) and Dominic’s drumming including gorgeous cinematics in between songs plus the structures built for the stage, pyrotechnics and confetti made the show really engaging and made everyone’s night much better. A spectacular show for a band that has been together for about 25 years and still bringing their signature electronic rock sounds as the heart of every show today, I can’t wait to catch them at Toronto again when they come back!",

Jared Leto can come off SUPER douchie but he is still charming and talented.\nMuse puts on one of the top 3 rock shows I have ever seen in my life. There is nothing I can say that is negative about that show.\nKeybank Pavilion\nBurgettstown, PA\nOct 08, 2018\nBria\nThis is our 3rd time seeing Muse. Once indoors at Mandalay Bay, once outdoor at Aftershock in Sacramento. This was, BY FAR, the best show I've seen them do. Out of the hundreds of shows I've been to in my life, this was in the top 5. Energy, light show, stage presence, song choices, and stage props were OFF THE HOOK! Can't wait to see them again!\nT-Mobile Arena\nLas Vegas, NV\nApr 10, 2023\nSolomon\nIt was so awesome! My third concert ever, and I've got to say that seeing them live was seriously one of the coolest things I've ever done. If you get a chance to go to a Muse concert, do not hesitate -- buy tickets right then and there, because you never know when the chance to have the time of your life will ever come again.\nNationwide Arena\nColumbus, OH\nMar 24, 2023\nVadim\nThe 2019 Moscow concert was insanely great! Great sound, stunning visuals, setlist was perfectly balanced between new hits and all-time greats, but most importantly the energy and atmosphere that Muse delivered: everything was world-class! Definitely *the* best show I’ve ever been to. Thanks Matt, Chris, Dominic and everybody in the crew for unforgettable memories. Can’t wait for you guys to come back in the future!\nLuzhniki Stadium\nMoskva, Russian Federation\nJun 17, 2019\nMELIRSE\nIncredible ! For a French fan, living this show in UK was ... perfect ! Even the fanbase was nice ! I know I am not totally objective because I love this band but I dont care, I enjoyed each moment and that's it !

The concert capped off another dynamic series of concerts at the Abu Dhabi F1 …\nContent: Live updates: Follow the latest on the 2024 Abu Dhabi F1\nBeing a rock group is a thankless business these days. With the hip-hop genre dominating the charts and a dazzling new wave of female singers leading an exciting phase of pop music, rock's significance on the large stage has largely been relegated to a handful of legacy and veteran artists.\nThis makes the UK group Muse an intriguing exception. Now well into their third decade, they continue to capture attention with high-concept albums and grandiose concerts brimming with pomp and spectacle.\nEven when there isn’t a new album on the horizon, the trio remains ready to deliver a spectacle, as crowds discovered on Sunday at Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Park.\nPerforming the closing concert of the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix, the show marked their first of the year and started a jaunt that will see them play at Riyadh’s Soundstorm Festival on Friday.\nThe time in between shows hasn’t left them rusty, with the group entering to recorded chants and launching into a blazing version of Won’t Stand Down.\nIt is a shape-shifting highlight. Singer and guitarist Matt Bellamy begins the track with an Eastern-inspired guitar motif before settling into a punchy verse, then launching the song into a wall of crushing guitars and Dominic Howard’s thunderous drumming.\nUp next is Hysteria with singer Bellamy’s potent vocal performance matched in intensity by Chris Wolstenholme’s dazzling bass lines. The song is one of their clearest examples of marrying sharp melodies with their signature technical, prog-rock prowess.\nIt conjures the kind of energy only a committed rock band can deliver. If the Abu Dhabi show is part of their long-awaited return to touring, we can confidently report that Muse shows no signs of losing their will.\nThe concert capped off another dynamic series of concerts at the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix. It began on Thursday with the double bill of DJ Peggy Gou and soul singer Teddy Swims, followed a day later by Maroon 5, before Eminem performed to a capacity crowd of 40,000 people on Saturday.\nAll tickets were exclusive to Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ticket holders.\nSPEC%20SHEET%3A%20NOTHING%20PHONE%20(2A)\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDisplay%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%206.7-inch%20flexible%20Amoled%2C%202%2C412%20x%201%2C080%2C%20394ppi%2C%20120Hz%2C%20Corning%20Gorilla%20Glass%205%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EProcessor%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20MediaTek%20Dimensity%207%2C200%20Pro%2C%204nm%2C%20octa-core%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMemory%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%208%2F12GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECapacity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20128%2F256GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPlatform%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Android%2014%2C%20Nothing%20OS%202.5%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual%2050MP%20main%2C%20f%2F1.88%20%2B%2050MP%20ultra-wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3B%20OIS%2C%20EIS%2C%20auto-focus%2C%20ultra%20XDR%2C%20night%20mode%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%20video%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%204K%20%40%2030fps%2C%20full-HD%20%40%2060fps%3B%20slo-mo%20full-HD%20at%20120fps%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EFront%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2032MP%20wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBattery%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%205%2C000mAh%3B%2050%25%20in%2030%20minutes%20with%2045-watt%20charger%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EConnectivity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Wi-Fi%2C%20Bluetooth%205.3%2C%20NFC%20(Google%20Pay)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBiometrics%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Fingerprint%2C%20face%20unlock%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EI%2FO%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20USB-C%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDurability%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20IP54%2C%20limited%20protection%20from%20water%2Fdust%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECards%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual-nano%20SIM%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EColours%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Black%2C%20milk%2C%20white%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EIn%20the%20box%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Nothing%20Phone%20(2a)%2C%20USB-C-to-USB-C%20cable%2C%20pre-applied%20screen%20protector%2C%20Sim%20tray%20ejector%20tool%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPrice%20(UAE)%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dh1%2C199%20(8GB%2F128GB)%20%2F%20Dh1%2C399%20(12GB%2F256GB)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\nNEW%20PRICING%20SCHEME%20FOR%20APPLE%20MUSIC%2C%20TV%2B%20AND%20ONE\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20Music%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2410.99%20(from%20%249.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.99%20(from%20%2414.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EIndividual%20annual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%24109%20(from%20%2499)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20TV%2B%3Cbr%3EMonthly%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%246.99%20(from%20%244.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EAnnual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2469%20(from%20%2449.99)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20One%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.95%20(from%20%2414.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2422.95%20(from%20%2419.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20premier%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2432.95%20(from%20%2429.95)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\nDr Amal Khalid Alias revealed a recent case of a woman with daughters, who specifically wanted a boy.\nA semen analysis of the father showed abnormal sperm so the couple required IVF.\nOut of 21 eggs collected, six were unused leaving 15 suitable for IVF.\nA specific procedure was used, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection where a single sperm cell is inserted into the egg.\nOn day three of the process, 14 embryos were biopsied for gender selection.\nThe next day, a pre-implantation genetic report revealed four normal male embryos, three female and seven abnormal samples.\nDay five of the treatment saw two male embryos transferred to the patient.\nThe woman recorded a positive pregnancy test two weeks later.\nThe Sand Castle\nDirector: Matty Brown\nStars: Nadine Labaki, Ziad Bakri, Zain Al Rafeea, Riman Al Rafeea\nRating: 2.5/5\nLiving in...\nThis article is part of a guide on where to live in the UAE.

The webpage centers primarily on the band Muse's performance at the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix, marking a significant event in their touring schedule. \n\nThe content provides details about their recent concert, highlights their performance style and setlist, and suggests the possibility of a return to touring, which directly relates to the search for insights into recent music activity. However, it does not mention any new singles or music videos, collaborations, interviews, or future projects. The specific mention of a concert and some performance context aligns partly with the information sought but lacks broader scope across all dimensions of musical activity requested.\n\nThus, while the content provides valuable insights into Muse's recent concert performance, it doesn’t cover all aspects outlined in the initial query, particularly the absence of mentions regarding new releases or broader media activities. Therefore, it partially satisfies the requirements of the search.\n</think>\n<answer>\npartially satisfy\n</answer>",

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

It demonstrates a heavier, metal-influenced direction for the new material.\nA new Muse album, which will be their first since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’, has been expected for some time. Back in May 2020, Bellamy told NME that the band were planning on spending the following year recording back in their hometown of Teignmouth in Devon.\n“We’re likely to get in the studio next year to make a new album of some kind and then tour after that, depending on the travel restrictions,” he said.\nA few months later, he told The Sun that his new songs were inspired by that year’s Black Lives Matter protests against racial inequality.\n“I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off,” he said. “It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.”\nLast year also saw the release of a remixed version of the band’s 2001 album ‘Origin Of Symmetry’, marking the record’s 20th anniversary, as well as a Record Store Day exclusive album of Matt Bellamy solo recordings called ‘Cryosleep’.\nBellamy also formed a part of the supergroup The Jaded Hearts Club, alongside Miles Kane and Graham Coxon, who released a cover of Northern Soul classic ‘Do I Love You (Indeed I Do).\nMuse have already announced a number huge festival headline shows for this summer. They’ll play Isle of Wight Festival in June, alongside the likes of Lewis Capaldi and Kasabian, followed by a set at Madrid’s Mad Cool Festival the following month, plus shows at Germanys’s Rock am Ring and Rock im Park.",

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

It demonstrates a heavier, metal-influenced direction for the new material.\nA new Muse album, which will be their first since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’, has been expected for some time. Back in May 2020, Bellamy told NME that the band were planning on spending the following year recording back in their hometown of Teignmouth in Devon.\n“We’re likely to get in the studio next year to make a new album of some kind and then tour after that, depending on the travel restrictions,” he said.\nA few months later, he told The Sun that his new songs were inspired by that year’s Black Lives Matter protests against racial inequality.\n“I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off,” he said. “It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.”\nLast year also saw the release of a remixed version of the band’s 2001 album ‘Origin Of Symmetry’, marking the record’s 20th anniversary, as well as a Record Store Day exclusive album of Matt Bellamy solo recordings called ‘Cryosleep’.\nBellamy also formed a part of the supergroup The Jaded Hearts Club, alongside Miles Kane and Graham Coxon, who released a cover of Northern Soul classic ‘Do I Love You (Indeed I Do).\nMuse have already announced a number huge festival headline shows for this summer. They’ll play Isle of Wight Festival in June, alongside the likes of Lewis Capaldi and Kasabian, followed by a set at Madrid’s Mad Cool Festival the following month, plus shows at Germanys’s Rock am Ring and Rock im Park.",

This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.”\nNow the band has offered more details on what to expect, telling Apple Music 1 that the album spans genres.\n“We’ve always tried to think outside the box,” Bellamy said (via NME). “We’ve never been one particular genre.\n“This album goes from metal all the way to pop to my first version to an Adele song… a lot of electronica. It’s like a full…We produced it ourselves. We were analysing everything we’ve done to date. The last song on the album is called ‘We Are Fucking Fucked’. I’m really happy and proud of it. I genuinely think it’s our best album.”\nBellamy also revealed that he let drummer Dominic Howard “take the lead a little bit” on this project.\n“That’s why this album’s taken two years. Every decision takes like a week for him to come back to us. Normally I just rush everything. With him he’s really slow, takes his time with every decision. I allowed him to make a lot of decisions about what was good and what wasn’t.”\nLast week Muse released latest single ‘Compliance’, following January’s comeback track ‘Won’t Stand Down’ – their first new music since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’.\n‘Will Of The People’ is available to pre-order here.\n‘Will of the People’ tracklist:\n1. ‘Will Of The People‘\n2. ‘Compliance‘\n3. ‘Liberation‘\n4. ‘Won’t Stand Down‘\n5. ‘Ghosts (How Can I Move On)‘\n6. ‘You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween‘\n7. ‘Kill Or Be Killed‘\n8. ‘Verona‘\n9. ‘Euphoria‘\n10. ‘We Are Fucking Fucked‘",

Meanwhile, Aitch’s debut album Close to Home became the first NFT project to enter the UK Official Chart last week.\nSerenade founder Max Shand wrote on Twitter that Muse’s pioneering ‘Digital Pressing’ would be “the first of many to come”.\nHe added: “With each release, we will be supporting artists who want to give their fans a deeper experience of their music through engaging, collectible Web3 formats that make sense.”\nEarlier this year, Matt Bellamy described Will of the People as the bands “best” record yet.\n“We’ve always tried to think outside the box,” Bellamy told Apple Music 1 (via NME). “We’ve never been one particular genre.\n“This album goes from metal all the way to pop to my first version to an Adele song… a lot of electronica. It’s like a full…We produced it ourselves. We were analysing everything we’ve done to date. The last song on the album is called ‘We Are Fucking Fucked’. I’m really happy and proud of it. I genuinely think it’s our best album.”\nMatt Bellamy and co. will embark on a new UK stadium tour in 2023, performing four dates in Plymouth, Huddersfield, Glasgow and Milton Keynes.

See all your …\nContent: Muse is currently touring across 5 countries and has 5 upcoming concerts.\nTheir next tour date is at Unknown venue in Turku, after that they'll be at Hellfest in Clisson.\nSee all your opportunities to see them live below!Santiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.",

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Knights of Cydonia,\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\nThe \"Complejo al Río\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \"campo trasero\" you couldn't see anything.\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \"NOOO\" which meant hearing even less.\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nOver the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001.\nFrom humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled.\nThe band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe.\nFrom that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding.\nWith Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic.\nSince their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences.\nAs the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims.\nNo matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return.\nSantiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nI had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena.\nMuse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album.\nMy only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out.\nGreat performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole.\nWe came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin. I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again. It was so worth it. They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers. They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool. I can watch it again if I want. So, so worth it. The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered. It's hard to describe, but it looked really good. The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired. It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well. It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse. If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes.\nAn impressive start with \"Psycho\" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, \"Drones\", but also included some classics as \"Plug In Baby\", \"Stockholm Syndrome\", and an amazing performance of \"Citizen Erased\", a song from \"Origin of Symmetry\" rarely played in the latest years shows.\nThe stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics.\nBellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic \"Time Is Running Out\", as well as \"Starlight\" and the whole chorus for \"Uprising\".\nA great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment.\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.\nSaw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon.\nWant to see Muse in concert?

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

See all your …\nContent: Muse is currently touring across 5 countries and has 5 upcoming concerts.\nTheir next tour date is at Unknown venue in Turku, after that they'll be at Hellfest in Clisson.\nSee all your opportunities to see them live below!Santiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.",

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Knights of Cydonia,\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\nThe \"Complejo al Río\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \"campo trasero\" you couldn't see anything.\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \"NOOO\" which meant hearing even less.\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nOver the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001.\nFrom humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled.\nThe band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe.\nFrom that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding.\nWith Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic.\nSince their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences.\nAs the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims.\nNo matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return.\nSantiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nI had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena.\nMuse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album.\nMy only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out.\nGreat performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole.\nWe came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin. I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again. It was so worth it. They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers. They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool. I can watch it again if I want. So, so worth it. The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered. It's hard to describe, but it looked really good. The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired. It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well. It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse. If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes.\nAn impressive start with \"Psycho\" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, \"Drones\", but also included some classics as \"Plug In Baby\", \"Stockholm Syndrome\", and an amazing performance of \"Citizen Erased\", a song from \"Origin of Symmetry\" rarely played in the latest years shows.\nThe stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics.\nBellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic \"Time Is Running Out\", as well as \"Starlight\" and the whole chorus for \"Uprising\".\nA great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment.\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.\nSaw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon.\nWant to see Muse in concert?

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

Matthew’s superb vocals along with Chris’ bass playing (my favourite) and Dominic’s drumming including gorgeous cinematics in between songs plus the structures built for the stage, pyrotechnics and confetti made the show really engaging and made everyone’s night much better. A spectacular show for a band that has been together for about 25 years and still bringing their signature electronic rock sounds as the heart of every show today, I can’t wait to catch them at Toronto again when they come back!",

Jared Leto can come off SUPER douchie but he is still charming and talented.\nMuse puts on one of the top 3 rock shows I have ever seen in my life. There is nothing I can say that is negative about that show.\nKeybank Pavilion\nBurgettstown, PA\nOct 08, 2018\nBria\nThis is our 3rd time seeing Muse. Once indoors at Mandalay Bay, once outdoor at Aftershock in Sacramento. This was, BY FAR, the best show I've seen them do. Out of the hundreds of shows I've been to in my life, this was in the top 5. Energy, light show, stage presence, song choices, and stage props were OFF THE HOOK! Can't wait to see them again!\nT-Mobile Arena\nLas Vegas, NV\nApr 10, 2023\nSolomon\nIt was so awesome! My third concert ever, and I've got to say that seeing them live was seriously one of the coolest things I've ever done. If you get a chance to go to a Muse concert, do not hesitate -- buy tickets right then and there, because you never know when the chance to have the time of your life will ever come again.\nNationwide Arena\nColumbus, OH\nMar 24, 2023\nVadim\nThe 2019 Moscow concert was insanely great! Great sound, stunning visuals, setlist was perfectly balanced between new hits and all-time greats, but most importantly the energy and atmosphere that Muse delivered: everything was world-class! Definitely *the* best show I’ve ever been to. Thanks Matt, Chris, Dominic and everybody in the crew for unforgettable memories. Can’t wait for you guys to come back in the future!\nLuzhniki Stadium\nMoskva, Russian Federation\nJun 17, 2019\nMELIRSE\nIncredible ! For a French fan, living this show in UK was ... perfect !

The concert capped off another dynamic series of concerts at the Abu Dhabi F1 …\nContent: Live updates: Follow the latest on the 2024 Abu Dhabi F1\nBeing a rock group is a thankless business these days. With the hip-hop genre dominating the charts and a dazzling new wave of female singers leading an exciting phase of pop music, rock's significance on the large stage has largely been relegated to a handful of legacy and veteran artists.\nThis makes the UK group Muse an intriguing exception. Now well into their third decade, they continue to capture attention with high-concept albums and grandiose concerts brimming with pomp and spectacle.\nEven when there isn’t a new album on the horizon, the trio remains ready to deliver a spectacle, as crowds discovered on Sunday at Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Park.\nPerforming the closing concert of the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix, the show marked their first of the year and started a jaunt that will see them play at Riyadh’s Soundstorm Festival on Friday.\nThe time in between shows hasn’t left them rusty, with the group entering to recorded chants and launching into a blazing version of Won’t Stand Down.\nIt is a shape-shifting highlight. Singer and guitarist Matt Bellamy begins the track with an Eastern-inspired guitar motif before settling into a punchy verse, then launching the song into a wall of crushing guitars and Dominic Howard’s thunderous drumming.\nUp next is Hysteria with singer Bellamy’s potent vocal performance matched in intensity by Chris Wolstenholme’s dazzling bass lines. The song is one of their clearest examples of marrying sharp melodies with their signature technical, prog-rock prowess.\nIt conjures the kind of energy only a committed rock band can deliver. If the Abu Dhabi show is part of their long-awaited return to touring, we can confidently report that Muse shows no signs of losing their will.\nThe concert capped off another dynamic series of concerts at the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix. It began on Thursday with the double bill of DJ Peggy Gou and soul singer Teddy Swims, followed a day later by Maroon 5, before Eminem performed to a capacity crowd of 40,000 people on Saturday.\nAll tickets were exclusive to Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ticket holders.\nSPEC%20SHEET%3A%20NOTHING%20PHONE%20(2A)\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDisplay%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%206.7-inch%20flexible%20Amoled%2C%202%2C412%20x%201%2C080%2C%20394ppi%2C%20120Hz%2C%20Corning%20Gorilla%20Glass%205%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EProcessor%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20MediaTek%20Dimensity%207%2C200%20Pro%2C%204nm%2C%20octa-core%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMemory%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%208%2F12GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECapacity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20128%2F256GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPlatform%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Android%2014%2C%20Nothing%20OS%202.5%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual%2050MP%20main%2C%20f%2F1.88%20%2B%2050MP%20ultra-wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3B%20OIS%2C%20EIS%2C%20auto-focus%2C%20ultra%20XDR%2C%20night%20mode%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%20video%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%204K%20%40%2030fps%2C%20full-HD%20%40%2060fps%3B%20slo-mo%20full-HD%20at%20120fps%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EFront%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2032MP%20wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBattery%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%205%2C000mAh%3B%2050%25%20in%2030%20minutes%20with%2045-watt%20charger%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EConnectivity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Wi-Fi%2C%20Bluetooth%205.3%2C%20NFC%20(Google%20Pay)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBiometrics%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Fingerprint%2C%20face%20unlock%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EI%2FO%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20USB-C%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDurability%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20IP54%2C%20limited%20protection%20from%20water%2Fdust%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECards%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual-nano%20SIM%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EColours%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Black%2C%20milk%2C%20white%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EIn%20the%20box%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Nothing%20Phone%20(2a)%2C%20USB-C-to-USB-C%20cable%2C%20pre-applied%20screen%20protector%2C%20Sim%20tray%20ejector%20tool%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPrice%20(UAE)%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dh1%2C199%20(8GB%2F128GB)%20%2F%20Dh1%2C399%20(12GB%2F256GB)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\nNEW%20PRICING%20SCHEME%20FOR%20APPLE%20MUSIC%2C%20TV%2B%20AND%20ONE\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20Music%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2410.99%20(from%20%249.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.99%20(from%20%2414.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EIndividual%20annual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%24109%20(from%20%2499)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20TV%2B%3Cbr%3EMonthly%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%246.99%20(from%20%244.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EAnnual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2469%20(from%20%2449.99)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20One%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.95%20(from%20%2414.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2422.95%20(from%20%2419.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20premier%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2432.95%20(from%20%2429.95)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\nDr Amal Khalid Alias revealed a recent case of a woman with daughters, who specifically wanted a boy.\nA semen analysis of the father showed abnormal sperm so the couple required IVF.\nOut of 21 eggs collected, six were unused leaving 15 suitable for IVF.\nA specific procedure was used, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection where a single sperm cell is inserted into the egg.\nOn day three of the process, 14 embryos were biopsied for gender selection.\nThe next day, a pre-implantation genetic report revealed four normal male embryos, three female and seven abnormal samples.\nDay five of the treatment saw two male embryos transferred to the patient.\nThe woman recorded a positive pregnancy test two weeks later.\nThe Sand Castle\nDirector: Matty Brown\nStars: Nadine Labaki, Ziad Bakri, Zain Al Rafeea, Riman Al Rafeea\nRating: 2.5/5\nLiving in...\nThis article is part of a guide on where to live in the UAE.

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

It demonstrates a heavier, metal-influenced direction for the new material.\nA new Muse album, which will be their first since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’, has been expected for some time. Back in May 2020, Bellamy told NME that the band were planning on spending the following year recording back in their hometown of Teignmouth in Devon.\n“We’re likely to get in the studio next year to make a new album of some kind and then tour after that, depending on the travel restrictions,” he said.\nA few months later, he told The Sun that his new songs were inspired by that year’s Black Lives Matter protests against racial inequality.\n“I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off,” he said. “It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.”\nLast year also saw the release of a remixed version of the band’s 2001 album ‘Origin Of Symmetry’, marking the record’s 20th anniversary, as well as a Record Store Day exclusive album of Matt Bellamy solo recordings called ‘Cryosleep’.\nBellamy also formed a part of the supergroup The Jaded Hearts Club, alongside Miles Kane and Graham Coxon, who released a cover of Northern Soul classic ‘Do I Love You (Indeed I Do).\nMuse have already announced a number huge festival headline shows for this summer. They’ll play Isle of Wight Festival in June, alongside the likes of Lewis Capaldi and Kasabian, followed by a set at Madrid’s Mad Cool Festival the following month, plus shows at Germanys’s Rock am Ring and Rock im Park.",

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”",

It demonstrates a heavier, metal-influenced direction for the new material.\nA new Muse album, which will be their first since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’, has been expected for some time. Back in May 2020, Bellamy told NME that the band were planning on spending the following year recording back in their hometown of Teignmouth in Devon.\n“We’re likely to get in the studio next year to make a new album of some kind and then tour after that, depending on the travel restrictions,” he said.\nA few months later, he told The Sun that his new songs were inspired by that year’s Black Lives Matter protests against racial inequality.\n“I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off,” he said. “It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.”\nLast year also saw the release of a remixed version of the band’s 2001 album ‘Origin Of Symmetry’, marking the record’s 20th anniversary, as well as a Record Store Day exclusive album of Matt Bellamy solo recordings called ‘Cryosleep’.\nBellamy also formed a part of the supergroup The Jaded Hearts Club, alongside Miles Kane and Graham Coxon, who released a cover of Northern Soul classic ‘Do I Love You (Indeed I Do).\nMuse have already announced a number huge festival headline shows for this summer. They’ll play Isle of Wight Festival in June, alongside the likes of Lewis Capaldi and Kasabian, followed by a set at Madrid’s Mad Cool Festival the following month, plus shows at Germanys’s Rock am Ring and Rock im Park.",

This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.”\nNow the band has offered more details on what to expect, telling Apple Music 1 that the album spans genres.\n“We’ve always tried to think outside the box,” Bellamy said (via NME). “We’ve never been one particular genre.\n“This album goes from metal all the way to pop to my first version to an Adele song… a lot of electronica. It’s like a full…We produced it ourselves. We were analysing everything we’ve done to date. The last song on the album is called ‘We Are Fucking Fucked’. I’m really happy and proud of it. I genuinely think it’s our best album.”\nBellamy also revealed that he let drummer Dominic Howard “take the lead a little bit” on this project.\n“That’s why this album’s taken two years. Every decision takes like a week for him to come back to us. Normally I just rush everything. With him he’s really slow, takes his time with every decision. I allowed him to make a lot of decisions about what was good and what wasn’t.”\nLast week Muse released latest single ‘Compliance’, following January’s comeback track ‘Won’t Stand Down’ – their first new music since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’.\n‘Will Of The People’ is available to pre-order here.\n‘Will of the People’ tracklist:\n1. ‘Will Of The People‘\n2. ‘Compliance‘\n3. ‘Liberation‘\n4. ‘Won’t Stand Down‘\n5. ‘Ghosts (How Can I Move On)‘\n6. ‘You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween‘\n7. ‘Kill Or Be Killed‘\n8. ‘Verona‘\n9. ‘Euphoria‘\n10. ‘We Are Fucking Fucked‘",

Meanwhile, Aitch’s debut album Close to Home became the first NFT project to enter the UK Official Chart last week.\nSerenade founder Max Shand wrote on Twitter that Muse’s pioneering ‘Digital Pressing’ would be “the first of many to come”.\nHe added: “With each release, we will be supporting artists who want to give their fans a deeper experience of their music through engaging, collectible Web3 formats that make sense.”\nEarlier this year, Matt Bellamy described Will of the People as the bands “best” record yet.\n“We’ve always tried to think outside the box,” Bellamy told Apple Music 1 (via NME). “We’ve never been one particular genre.\n“This album goes from metal all the way to pop to my first version to an Adele song… a lot of electronica. It’s like a full…We produced it ourselves. We were analysing everything we’ve done to date. The last song on the album is called ‘We Are Fucking Fucked’. I’m really happy and proud of it. I genuinely think it’s our best album.”\nMatt Bellamy and co. will embark on a new UK stadium tour in 2023, performing four dates in Plymouth, Huddersfield, Glasgow and Milton Keynes. Tickets are on sale now and can be purchased here.",

Upcoming Major Developments\n\nThe legendary rock band MUSE is gearing up for an exciting new chapter with their highly anticipated album \"Eclipse,\" scheduled for release on March 20, 2025 [reference:18]. This announcement has generated significant buzz among fans worldwide, as it marks their first studio release since the successful \"Will of the People\" in 2022.\n\nThe band's 2025 world tour plans are taking shape, with an impressive lineup of performances scheduled across multiple continents. The tour will strategically coincide with the release of \"Eclipse,\" allowing fans to experience the new material live alongside classic favorites [reference:18]. The production promises to maintain MUSE's reputation for groundbreaking live performances, featuring their signature combination of theatrical elements and cutting-edge technology.\n\nFestival appearances for 2025 showcase MUSE's continued dominance in the live music scene. A particularly noteworthy highlight is their headlining slot at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, on June 22, 2025 - marking their triumphant return to the festival after a decade-long absence [reference:20]. The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].\n\nLooking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project \"in the next couple of months\" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.\n\n## 2. Recent Album Success - \"Will of the People\"\n\n\"Will of the People,\" released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for £20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since \"The 2nd Law\" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].\n\nCommercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].\n\nCritical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as \"the best music in these years\" [reference:1,3].\n\n## 3. Recent Tours and Performances\n\nThe Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13]. Memorable performances included shows at Madison Square Garden and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, where the band delivered extensive 22-song setlists [reference:11,14].\n\nThe European and Asian legs of the tour were equally impressive, with standout performances at iconic venues like Rome's Stadio Olimpico and London's O2 Arena [reference:9]. The shows have consistently featured elaborate production elements, including a square main stage with catwalk, transparent floor for lighting effects, and custom costumes including masks for specific songs [reference:13].\n\n## 4. Band Members' Activities\n\nChris Wolstenholme has embarked on an exciting new venture with his \"Chromes\" project, releasing two debut singles: \"Imaginary World\" and \"The Good Life\" [reference:25]. This marks his first major project as frontman and lyricist since his contributions to MUSE's \"The 2nd Law\" [reference:25].\n\nMatt Bellamy has been balancing personal and professional developments, recently welcoming his second child while also creating a musical score for Audible's adaptation of George Orwell's \"1984\" [reference:23]. He has also been engaging in public discourse, sharing his perspectives on \"Meta-Centrism\" and various social issues [reference:23].\n\n## 5. Future Outlook and Current Status\n\nMUSE currently stands at an interesting crossroads, operating as an unsigned band while exploring future label options [reference:23,24]. Despite this transition period, their creative output remains strong, with multiple projects in development. The band's current direction suggests a balance between maintaining their signature sound while continuing to push boundaries both musically and technologically. With two albums planned for the next two years and an extensive touring schedule, MUSE appears poised for another exciting chapter in their illustrious career.\n</article>",

Upcoming Major Developments\n\nThe legendary rock band MUSE is gearing up for an exciting new chapter with their highly anticipated album \"Eclipse,\" scheduled for release on March 20, 2025 [reference:18]. This announcement has generated significant buzz among fans worldwide, as it marks their first studio release since the successful \"Will of the People\" in 2022.\n\nThe band's 2025 world tour plans are taking shape, with an impressive lineup of performances scheduled across multiple continents. The tour will strategically coincide with the release of \"Eclipse,\" allowing fans to experience the new material live alongside classic favorites [reference:18]. The production promises to maintain MUSE's reputation for groundbreaking live performances, featuring their signature combination of theatrical elements and cutting-edge technology.\n\nFestival appearances for 2025 showcase MUSE's continued dominance in the live music scene. A particularly noteworthy highlight is their headlining slot at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, on June 22, 2025 - marking their triumphant return to the festival after a decade-long absence [reference:20]. The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].\n\nLooking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project \"in the next couple of months\" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.\n\n## 2. Recent Album Success - \"Will of the People\"\n\n\"Will of the People,\" released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for £20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since \"The 2nd Law\" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].\n\nCommercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].\n\nCritical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as \"the best music in these years\" [reference:1,3].\n\n## 3. Recent Tours and Performances\n\nThe Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13].
