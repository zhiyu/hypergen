# WriteHERE: Heterogeneous Recursive Planning based Open Writing Project

WriteHERE is an open-source, non-commercial agent framework for long-form writing that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types: retrieval, reasoning, and composition.

## Overview

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predetermined workflows and rigid thinking patterns, this framework:

1. **Eliminates workflow restrictions** through a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution
2. **Facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition** by integrating different task types
3. **Adapts dynamically** during the writing process, similar to human writing behavior

Our evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation demonstrate that this method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics.

## Open Source Philosophy

WriteHERE is developed with these core principles:

- **Fully Open Source**: All code is freely available for use, modification, and distribution under the MIT License
- **Non-Commercial**: Developed for research and educational purposes without commercial interests
- **Full Transparency**: The entire system architecture and decision-making processes are transparent to users
- **Community-Driven**: We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaborative improvements from the community

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Node.js 14+ (for the frontend)
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI (GPT models)
  - Anthropic (Claude models)
  - SerpAPI (for search functionality in report generation)

### Quick Start

#### Standard Installation

For the easiest start, just run:

```bash
./setup_env.sh  # One-time setup of the environment
./start.sh      # Start the application
```

This will:
1. Create a clean Python virtual environment
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Start the backend server on port 5001
4. Start the frontend on port 3000
5. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

#### For Anaconda/Miniconda Users

If you're using Anaconda and encounter dependency conflicts, use:

```bash
./run_with_anaconda.sh
```

This script will create a dedicated Anaconda environment called 'writehere' with the correct dependencies and run both servers.

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common problems and solutions.

### Manual Installation

#### Backend Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install main dependencies:
```bash
pip install -v -e .
```

3. Install backend server dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

4. API Keys setup (optional - can also be done via the web UI):
```bash
# Create api_key.env file based on example
cp recursive/api_key.env.example recursive/api_key.env
# Edit the file to add your keys
nano recursive/api_key.env
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python server.py
```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Real-time Task Visualization

The system features real-time visualization of the task execution process. As the agent works on generating content, you can see:

1. The hierarchical decomposition of tasks
2. Which tasks are currently being worked on
3. The status of each task (ready, in progress, completed)
4. The type of each task (retrieval, reasoning, composition)

This visualization gives you insight into the agent's "thinking process" and helps you understand how complex writing tasks are broken down and solved step by step.

To view the task execution in real-time, simply start a generation job and watch the task list update automatically as the agent works.
